Now my true reason why am now leaving comment and statement as I said I am a person with a double disability or in this case on many stages multiple disabilities and I utilize much like many who go to this mall with disabilities they utilize A paratransit service I was made aware where the new stand for access paratransit will be placed it is incredibly inconvenient in the place by which the stand is posted I say this because it is next to a multi tiered parking lot right next to Macy's that is a very dangerous place when it gets dark especially for your disabled your elderly and even for just general people taking even the local dialer ride system. Could there not have been a better place to have put your stand for your customers waiting for para transit or transportation to assist them that is just poor taste and if anything it sends a message that your mom does not like or just not want the disabled shopping at this mall which is actually quite saddening to me and many and I know with disabilities because it is a beautiful mall there is so much this mall offers versus dare I say Glendale Galleria for an example yes it's a nice small to but I would choose Arcadia over Glendale in a heartbeat yes Arcadia is much farther for me but I still like Arcadia. There are more stores there are more selections there are nice places to actually sit and relax you just need a Starbucks in your mall and it would be perfect that and an Apple Store but who cares you have a movie theater in your mall you have an excellent staff at that movie theater by the way they also need to upgrade and as well have narrative equipment such as headphone checks for films for the blind that must be narrated because many blind people like to watch movies too we listen to them instead of watching them picture by picture as people do with site I've had to learn this from day one when losing my eyesight it's only been eight knack years for me I am now 40 of course but I'm learning more and more these are just some things that your mom could offer to its patrons but you do have many great stories that a lot of shopping malls don't provide and this is what makes your mall unique it would be nice if there was a more appropriate \"\"Stand\"\" for it's disabled patrons to therefore be picked up in where it was not a safety hazard in other words, not next to a multi tiered parking lot I'm sure there are plenty of spaces that your proprietary management and mall management could find and discuss that would be more appropriate."

So if you are handicapped you are definitely going to have a hard time getting in and out of the shower they do have handlebars but that's not enough if your 96 years old and you have a hard time lifting your leg to get in the tub."

I was approached by a man, who clearly had his own disability, and asked to leave. I told him my dog was a service dog, and it's against the law to ask me to leave. First, I am flabbergasted that a disabled person would have the audacity to discriminate against another disabled person. Second, my dog was clearly visible during the whole game, and properly identifiable as a service animal. I would strongly suggest that in future situations that your staff or employees are advised that causing someone with a disability undo stress, embarrassment, and confrontation is punishable by civil law. I will continue to attend whatever functions my family may have at this property as it is a public domain, and my service dog will be accompanying me as provided by law."
