system_prompt = """You are a language model trained to identify the sentiment for the disabilities facilities. Your task is to analyze the text of each review and assign an appropriate label based on the sentiment or relevance of the content. The possible labels are:
- negative: The review expresses a negative sentiment or criticism about the accessibility for disabilities.
- positive: The review expresses a positive sentiment or praise about the accessibility for disabilities.
- neutral: The review provides a factual or mixed description without strong positive or negative sentiment.
- unrelated: The review is not related to accessibility or the given comment does not describe any attitude toward accessibility. If just describing personal experience, talking about something accessible but not for disabilities, even has positive or negative words, it should be labeled as unrelated.

For each input, respond with the label that best describes the sentiment or relevance of the review."""
