{"text":"I cannot say enough positive things about Brookson. I am not even sure where to begin. As a resident who has medical disabilities, it can be hard for me to carry supplies that come in via mail up to my apartment. However, the other day, the mail carrier didn\u2019t follow instructions to properly deliver my medical supplies so I had no way of getting them up to my apartment myself but Ryan immediately offered and jumped in to help me. I\u2019ve never met such kind and caring people from Ryan to Macey at the front desk. They\u2019ve always gone above and beyond what they are required. The apartment was also very clean upon move in with next to nothing to fix or clean ourselves. The appliances are updated and the finishes are beautiful such as the granite countertops. I love how spacious the bedrooms and bathrooms are as well as the kitchen. Also, the apartment comes with a washed & dryer so you can\u2019t beat that especially for the price with rent!!! The grounds at Brookson are well-kept and I love the different areas such as the swinging benches to enjoy the nice weather. The amenities are amazing from the resort style pool to the 24\/7 cafe lounge to the gym. I love how social this complex is and has been even with COVID, they\u2019ve tried to still have classes available such as yoga and events such as curbside food trucks and free food such as chic-fil-a breakfast one of the mornings :) The only things I can complain about is the noise in the parking lot where our building is as we have had some issues with some residents being loud with noise complaints and frequently cops having to come by but other than that, we haven\u2019t had many other issues. I would suggest you get checks to pay rent instead though because the fee they charge you to use their portal to pay via card is pricey .The residents seem to be very friendly that live here and I overall feel safe. A lot of residents also have pups and it\u2019s a nice place to socialize with your doggos with the dog park too and spa. We will be renewing our lease again  and look forward to living yet another amazing year here :)","target_text":"As a resident who has medical disabilities, it can be hard for me to carry supplies that come in via mail up to my apartment.","annotation":"negative"}

{"text":"Stuart Shooting Center is by far, my most liked shooting range that I have been to. All of the employees are always courteous and eager to answer any and all questions one may have. The facility is very modern and distinguished. It has all of the amenities that you would expect to see in any other state of the art shooting range\/facility. They also have a selection of classes that you can take to further your firearms education. One of which I can personally speak of and recommend, the CPL course. Travis was very professional and informative with his instruction in the \u201cConcealed Carry\u201d course, and I found the class to be invaluable.\n\nNot only is Stuart Shooting Center all off the above, but what it is that I like most, is the accessibility of the facility. I am a paraplegic and wheelchair user going on 19 years. I have been in some facilities over the years that are somewhat difficult to maneuver in, and even one(not naming names) in Port St. Lucie, that is not accessible at all. But at Stuart Shooting Center, they go above and beyond to make sure my shooting experience is as comfortable as possible, such as allowing me to call before I come, to reserve a lane, holding the doors for me, etc.. They even reserve the very first or second lane, so I have ease of access to the doors leading in and out of the range. Now this may sound intuitive, but their restroom is also handicap accessible. I have been in some other ranges where the bathrooms weren\u2019t.\n\nIf there is anything to take away from my review, it\u2019s that I have not once been dissatisfied with my experience at STC and that you are sure to be satisfied with your time and money spent.\n\nThere\u2019s even a comfortable viewing area, if you are someone who is just tagging along and doesn\u2019t want to partake in the sport.\n\nThank you STC for my experience over these past several years!","target_text":"Not only is Stuart Shooting Center all off the above, but what it is that I like most, is the accessibility of the facility.

{"text":"I have an extremely aggressive case of Multiple Sclerosis and I am now in a wheelchair with only the controlled use of 1 arm and no legs. i have been a patient for a little over a year and without notice was terminated as a patient for the horrible act of making a complaint to Dr Kadivar directly about the office manager(Elise I think her name is) messing up my refill requests. He had me on 90 day U.A. cycles for a painkiller for 3 30 day refills, that after the first 30 days I would have no refills left, leaving me to argue with the manager that i didnt need to do another U.A. for 60 days. This has occurred, 4 out of 5 U.A. cycles over the last 15 months. The complaint specifically was over being up on multiple times when I asked to speak to the doctor, being told that he doesnt speak to patients on the phone, has no email, and I would be thrown out and cops called if I showed up to wait for him.hand to god I never yelled or swore at this woman to get this level of reaction, only walked her through the errors \"someone in the office\" is making. I had to schedule a video appointment with him in order to make the complaint and  pay for that pleasure on top of it. He told me he really leaned on her to run things and in situations like this best to discharge me from his care. No investigation, no I'll look into it, no condolences. I didn't ask him to fire her or even write her up. I simply wanted him to straighten out the refill issue.","target_text":"I have an extremely aggressive case of Multiple Sclerosis and I am now in a wheelchair with only the controlled use of 1 arm and no legs.","annotation":"unrelated"}

I then went to my scheduled appt. and literally waited 2 hours for the provider to see me. Once he came in the room I was asked what I was there for because Optum sent the wrong referral and paperwork. When I told him he basically said he would fill out my paperwork for $100 a page and that included any pages he would need to review. He basically told me he only did workers comp claims and asked me who my lawyer was. Wow again Optum pulled through and sent me on a wild goose chase. What a waste of my time and money. Optum is not there for their patients and clearly don\u2019t know how to run a clinic. DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. THEY ARE INCOMPETENT AND HAVE POOR PATIENT CARE! The sad part is I\u2019ve been to this clinic for years and they have had no problem taking my money but when I needed their help they weren\u2019t there.","target_text":"Don\u2019t waste your time at this clinic, especially if you have a disability.

This was to replace an older system which was installed back in Dec2007.\n\nGlad I found Cinnamon Energy to assist me selecting a new system that meets my energy needs.  The most important criteria in selecting a solar installer for me was to find a vendor who is local, accessible and been around for at least ten years.  Although solar system is mostly a plug and forget type of thing I value the fact that I am able to call for assistance when need arises.\n\nAs we went through system selection I found their recommended options were priced competitively and of reasonable quality material.  I met Jonathan who came to my house to diagnosed my old Sunnyboy inverter, and took measurement of my roof.  It was a very informative meeting which solidified our decision to replace the old system.\n\nI had a pleasure of working with Paula Doan on system selection and pricing.  She provided a reasonable quote and a completion date that I was happy with, and so we had a contract in Docusign drafted.  I found Paula was extremely knowledgeable, pleasant, professional and truthful.\n\nInstallation finished a day ahead of schedule; system turned on and started producing.

They are the ones who make it all happen, who are helping each other who are helping the customers. Each one who made eye contact with me smiled but I could feel the tension of his presence. Even after he took my order I went back and he gave me a look with his hands as if I was bothering him because I forgot to add bacon to a burger. We come here with family, friends, or coworkers to enjoy the meal and the people but this man doesn't provide the quality of Culver's culture, history or presence. I was asking different employees was he always with a unwelcoming nature and they said unfortunately yes. Unlike the supervisor above his rank who should be taking in account of his presence and behavior toward his employees and people who walk in the door.

{"text":"On 8\/16\/2020 my 13 year old Braun Entervan had its last problem that I was willing to deal with! It was time to buy a new one. My only problem was that the van cost north of 60k and being disabled and owning my current van out right , it was going to really hurt to have a payment. Well I had to bite the bullet and pull the trigger on the sale! But the stress from buying the first one was fresh in my mind from 2007. What a nightmare,  I was so upset I thew up when I found out that it was 58k. Well I found a dealer in Lakeland Florida who was about an hour away and my wife and I went. When we got there we met a nice gentleman named William and we talked about what I wanted and what I had looked at on thier website. I was on the fence on which one I could get the best deal on. Well about 15 minutes later Gus the owner showed up and was eager to help. After about 30 mins I decided on a van. I didn't even have that one on my radar.  It was better than the ones I was looking at. We went into his office which he shares with his daughter Karen who was busy with a customer on the phone. She did take the time to say hello and introduce herself after the call. She is as friendly as everyone else. So Gus and I finalized the deal and I was passed on to the the office Mgr Bridget. Bridget was so nice and accommodating.  I thought to myself this is too easy. Well the misses (Tina) and myself filled out the paperwork and was pretty confident that that's the one I wanted. I was in and out of there in 2 \u00b9\/\u00b2 hours flat. Found , bought , traded and filled out paperwork that fast. Now being a wheelchair van that pretty much gives away the info I'm  handicapped. I need special controls and a certain type of seat to transfer.  Those items are specific to each individual's needs so they had to be ordered.  The next week and several emails from Bridget about things she needed from me for the finance company and we were all set. Remember I said I was an hour away more like 1hr 20 mins so Mobility America (William) was kind enough to deliver the van to me , pickup my trade and do the whole walk around the new Chysler Pacifica I purchased. From showing the vans to selling me mine I am very impressed with the whole team at Mobility America! Thank you again William, Gus , Karen and Bridget  for all your help making this process as easy and smooth as possible.\nAJ & Tina SMITH","target_text":"My only problem was that the van cost north of 60k and being disabled and owning my current van out right , it was going to really hurt to have a payment.

{"text":"Let me start by saying this: As convenient as this hotel is - it is not for parents traveling with small children.\nAs a new military wife I was traveling by myself. I expected a bit more as far as pleasantries go but I guess that really isn\u2019t their way.\nWe arrived around 8pm. It was raining when we arrived so we parked under the overhang. The good part - we were covered. The bad part is that there are benches and smokers sit there. So you\u2019re getting your family out all while inhaling smoke. I\u2019m not a smoker - so this was ridiculous to me.\n\nWhen we walked in, the lobby wasn\u2019t terribly busy so that was good. We booked using a 3rd party. I\u2019ve never had to put down a card for incidentals when using a 3rd party. The guest services said this was how they do it. I was only staying one night so I didn\u2019t see the point. In the past, when we have stayed at Hilton properties, whether if we chose to not put down a card for incidentals - that was fine.\n\nThe room was nice but far too close to the elevator for my personal taste. Couldn\u2019t figure out how to adjust the air and they didn\u2019t have extra blankets.\n\nIf you are staying here for the convenience of the breakfast - pass on it. Breakfast is prewrapped items that you must microwave. If you wanted toast it was in a bag with no tongs to grab the bread. Unsanitary. There are only 3 or 4 tables for breakfast goers to sit and they are right in the lobby.\n\nWhen leaving we were not greeted nor thanked.

{"text":"On 2\/15\/2018 I go to Jefferson Family Physicians because of my accident at work on 2\/2\/2018. I see Dr. Dillard and tell her about all the issues I'm having and at first I thought she was trying to help me but within a couple of months I realize that she's only trying to help everyone else and not me.I try  to get her to let me to do another MRI but she will not approve it. I even show her pictures of the crack and fracture in my odontoid but she says she's not a radiologist and tells me that she doesn't know how to tell if you have a crack or fracture. Dr. Dillard is a MD and has been practicing medicine for over 30 years. I'm pretty confident that she should know how to notice a crack and fracture or she doesn't need to be able to practice medicine. I could go on and on about Dr. Dillard but I want and I'll just tell everyone about our last conversation the two of us had at the end of July. I go to Jefferson Family Physicians to pick up my long term disability paperwork that she has which she doesn't include an evaluation on it about my physicial limits but I still approved because of OCR. While their I tell some of the people in line about Dr. Dillard and how she handled my healthcare and so on. After I receive my paperwork I go to my car and start to back out and the Dr. Dillard comes outside to talk to me. She tells me that she doesn't appreciate me upsetting her patients and I tell her that she is upsetting me and she says I am now. Dr. Dillard tells me that she is the one that set my appointment up with Ortho Knoxville which she didn't I did so myself. I ask Dr. Dillard if the reason she treated me the way that she did was because I had a accident at work and she says, \"I don't know.\" Dr. Dillard lies the whole conversation which I also have a recording of this conversation along with a lot more. In the diagnosis of why Dr. Dillard says I can't work she puts down TBI, cervical radiculopathy, lumbar radiculopathy, depression, paranoia, etc. It only takes Dr. Dillard 5 months to come to that conclusion in July about the accident I had in February. They are a couple other doctors I say also at Jefferson Family Physicians that are not good doctors also bit I want mention them yet. So if you have an accident at work don't go to Jefferson Family Physicians because they don't care about the working person and will help try to cover everything up.

{"text":"I was here about three years ago amd I will never return. Mr.Dr.McCurdy was very respectful and a very good doctor. My experience with Mrs.Dr.McCurdy, on the other hand was a nightmare. I came in with an eye ulcer and Mr.Dr.McCirdy helped me a lot and asked for a second follow up visit to see how my eye was feeling. When I returned I did not seem him. I saw his wife who works along side him. I was ok with this until she figured out I was a victim of a rare disease. When this became apparent to her, she began pestering me with questions. It ended with her asking \"If you would mind me taking a couple pictures of your eyes?\" I was reluctant but agreed. Instead of using the provided equipment to take professional pictures, she instead took the machine with a light and mirrors and instead of putting her eye to it, she took two pictures with her iPhone 7. I remember it being an iPhone 7 because it stated that it was on the bill right next to the 75$ price tag of each picture she took. After this I did not want to return for my yearly eye exam but I agreed to with the condition I would Mr.Dr.McCurdy instead of Mrs. So when we made the appointment we made it VERY clear we wanted him, not her. Well wouldn't you know it, who do I see when I walk in the door of the doctor's office. She was happily smiling with one of her nurses there. I sat in the chair waiting for the exam to begin. Instead of doing that, she asks the nurse to sit there and stare at my deformed eyes. After a couple minutes, I spoke up and asked if we could start the exam. She agreed and proceeded to put dilating drops in my eyes. When she got down to look she asked if I still had my contacts in. I said yes. She immediately pulls each of them out of my eye and throws them in the trash before I can react. I tell her those were my last contacts and she pulls them out of the trash and puts them in solution. Well we go on with exam even though I should've left right there. We finish and without asking me anything, she reaches to get the contacts and starts to try to put them in my eye. I ask her what she's doing and I explain to her I don't want contacts from the trash. She tries setting me up with a pair of sample contacts, which weren't even fit to my prescription, the equivalent of me putting on reading glasses when I'm legally blind without proper aid. She tells me we'd laugh this off and I left as quickly as possible. It's been three years or so, Mrs.McCurdy.

{"text":"Very beautiful and luxury hotel.  Grounds are beautiful and we saw deer on a couple of occasions.  Our room was well laid out and clean.  High ceilings giving the room an added bonus of space and quiet. ( No noise from the above floor.) Easy transportation to the WDW parks. Wheelchair and scooter accessible.  There is a small Exchange that has some supplies if needed as well as souvenirs of the Resort and Walt Disney World.  (Only those with a valid Military ID can purchase alcohol and tobacco products at the Exchange.)  There are Restaurants and the Evergreen bar by the pool.  Java and Ice cream place by the check in desk and a breakfast and lunch snack place enroute to the bus transportation stop.  I would have given this a 5 star review for how beautiful and great the staff are but I had two issues.  One was we got lost twice.  Once looking for the Evergreen bar to get a late dinner and to find another restaurant the other was finding our way back to the room in the dark.  The paths weren't lit very well and when we finally found a map on the path I had to use the flashlight feature of my phone to see it.   So for first time staying I'd recommend carrying a map.  The second issue is the hours of operation of the Exchange and food locations.  They close early.  If you want to pick up something after you get back from the park (like bottled water) the Exchange closes at 6 pm on some days and others 10pm.  The other places including the bar closed at 10 PM.  So no late night snacks or drinks.  This might just be because of the restriction from the pandemic but it would be nice to have somewhere to get drinkable water after spending all day at the parks. (Getting water before is tricky because the Exchange opens at 8 am and you're trying to catch the first bus before the park opens at that time.)  It also would have been nice to relax and have drinks with our party after the parks closed at 9 pm but the Evergreen Bar closed at 10pm.  So it was a grab takeout and go back to our rooms instead.

Of course because of my mothers condition she does not have drivers license and with her and my father both sick we have not been able to take her for an ID. My mother and father have shopped at Walmart on Myrtle School Road in Gastonia, N.C. since the store opened. They also get around 20 prescriptions there monthly.  So for years they both have shopped there with no problems until today. I took her to get their grocery and when she wrote the check the cashier refused it because of her license being out of date which by the way she has done a hundred times before today.I understand this might be company policy but this policy should be used always not just when ever. My 75 year old mother stood in line with tears in her eyes because she could not get her food and the embarrassment of having to put all her bags back down in front of other customers. I know your company is large and you could care less about a 75 year old man and woman who are both sick but this was uncalled for. I also buy my groceries and prescriptions there.

The mail lady is really the only one besides the gate guards that are actually considerate, friendly, and go above and beyond every day.\n\nThey made me prove my disability, prove that my (large breed) mobility service dog was actually a mobility service dog, and threatened to tow my truck if I were to park in a handicapped space because I am \"too young to have or need any of these things.\" They violated my civil rights as a human being and under the federal ADA laws. They lied about it too saying they have the legal right to make me prove my dog and myself as legally disabled.\n\nThe place is so incredibly loud. Sirens all the time and really loud traffic. You would almost thing there is a drag strip near by. Thats exactly it, the locals use the streets around the park as their own local drag strips. There is a fire station and an AMR ambulance station right next door. The fire station I swear is the busiest I have ever known. Sirens all the time!\n\nPeople jump the walls and gates all the time and steal or use the showers and bathrooms here. We have caught them so this comes from personal experience. A tree fell over on our site. Two weeks after telling them about it, it was still there at the front of the site waiting to be removed. I finally had to get rid of it myself.

{"text":"Been here visiting my husband and drive up here on a long drive to take my 2 year old swimming. Call before I arrive every time we come and ask if the slides are open as I made the trip a week and a half again and the slides were closed. Have been 4 more times and was told slides were open before leaving on the very long drive. Get to pool and the slides closed. Only one time out of the 5 I have been the water and was warm and the air temp was decent. Oct 19th the water was so cold we ended up staying only 30 min as my daughter was shivering. The life guards are rude ( not all) but for sure more than half, I wasted money paying to get in when coming for just water slides not told at counter they were closed and lied to when calling makes travel and planning hard on family\u2019s with toddlers. The play area inside is just ok. Have not had a chance to use other parts of center but looks decent. Locker rooms are ok and sometimes clean. Theft happens so make sure you lock up your stuff. The air pressure that comes through the door when leaving or interning the pool area from family rooms is so outstanding that a person with disabilities would not be able to operate and even more so may be a evacuation hazard. Could be a lawsuit if someone got hurt from them. It literally take every piece of my strength to open at times. There has even been a time where my daughter tried going in and it almost shut on her hands. I know a lot of people have complained and do complain about the hours, especially the pool hours and I got to add that this is really a downer. My husband gets off at 7 and is in able to enjoy the pool with our daughter because they close so earlier. The price is also very expensive. Just another way for the city to use the residents to build it but then charge them so much for it just because you can. I would say not a community based family oriented business. I think the Watford rec if driving through there like we do is cheaper and the water slides are nice and the staff is great works just as good if not better.","target_text":"The air pressure that comes through the door when leaving or interning the pool area from family rooms is so outstanding that a person with disabilities would not be able to operate and even more so may be a evacuation hazard.","annotation":"negative"}

{"text":"If I could give them less I would! The experience I had at this hospital is nothing less than terrible. I went in six years ago, 28 weeks pregnant, with a massive blood clot in my leg. They initially sent me upstairs to Labor and Delivery. There, the \"Doctor\" and I use that term loosely actually refused to see me, or even come in the room, because he \"didn't want to do the paperwork.' because I wasn't already a patient of his. Seriously?! Is it not your job as a doctor to treat people? By the way, he is Dr. Denhasse (sp) for all those who seem to think he walks on water. So, they tell me they are going to send me down to the E.R. in a wheel chair in a gown, but not to worry, because they have a room waiting for me. Instead, the plant me in the wheelchair, right next to the sliding doors to outside in a hospital gown 28 weeks pregnant waiting for 2+ hours! I am finally brought back after I just go get dressed and threaten to leave and go somewhere else. In hindsight I wish so very much I would have. The doctor in the ER sees me, and has no idea what to do for me. He is aghast at the size of the clot, cannot understand why the on Call OB wouldn't see me, as he has no idea what the protocol is for pregnant patients, and orders an ultrasound of my legs. There is no hematologist coming on the floor until the next day, possibly the day after as it was the day before Christmas Eve. The Ultrasound Tech does their thing, and not very well, as they completely MISS the deep vein thrombosis that is life threatening to both myself and my baby without treatment. I am finally dismissed with the promise to follow up with my OB. So, to recap, the on call OB refused to even look at me, the ultrasound tech missed the DVT, and the ER Doc did not know how to treat me. By the way, when I was able to see my OB she flipped out, ordered a new ultrasound, which did, in fact find the DVT. I was tested for clotting disorders and put on blood thinners that lasted years. The standard protocol for ANY pregnant person who presents with a clot is blood thinners, period. This hospital could have cost me my baby's life and my own. Fast forward five + years and I am still dealing with the nightmare of THAT night. They are SCAM artist, who work for their billing! My husband is Active Duty military. We pay out of pocket for the better form of our insurance. When I gave them our information they purposefully transposed two numbers which cause the payment to get refused by insurance. unbeknownst to us. Now the imaging department figured it out all on their own, and called me! They said, \"I noticed that what you wrote down, and what they entered is different by two numbers. It is getting kicked back in the system when we enter theirs, can you verify before we go with yours?\" Of course that bill went through fine, and was paid. The Emergency Physicians Services Billing department refused to bill it correctly, and charged over $1400 for what?? for not seeing me, and for doing absolutely nothing, no blood work, just looking at my leg and telling me they can't help me and to see my OB! $1400!! That, FYI is MORE than my deductible for the entire year and my catastrophic cap! Despite writing into their billing department, and call after call. Even speaking with my insurance company, who let me know they had 29 days left to submit it the right way, they assured me they would do it. I provided them with medical evidence of their negligence, and that they missed the DVT, etc. Instead they let the days pass, and sent it on to collections. It just has bounced around no matter who I speak to who assures me they will take it back to the company. I finally paid one company Early in 2017 $387 to make the calls stop, because they said it would wipe it out and we could just get it over with. Well guess what? I just had another call! This time for just shy of $1100! What? All that ever had to happen was the billing department enter the information the right way. If it didn't work, then call the patient! Instead, they do this! I am not the only person!

Dr. Flamini ended up being his primary doctor in the group. The seizure activity was captured during multiple inpatient  video monitoring admissions yet he said the were just \u201csub clinical seizures\u201d and of no consequence. The treatment was completely ineffective yet he refused to try ANY other medications and even threatened to call DFCS if I wouldn\u2019t comply. I was told to \u201cjust accept that my child was developmentally disabled\u201d, maybe I had Munchausen by proxy and just wanted attention....all the while my son\u2019s brain is frying every time he went to sleep.  Ended up finally getting a second, third and fourth opinion from Gainesville GA to Children\u2019s Hospital of Boston to MCG in Augusta. Turns out *I* wasn\u2019t the crazy one. He had been undiagnosed and untreated for an epileptic syndrome that occurs only in childhood and should have been easily diagnosed by Dr. Flamini and any other in the practice. All said it was blatant malpractice. He ended up needing brain surgery because by that time (2000) it was \u201ctoo little too late\u201d. All medical treatments failed.  He had to have the damaged portion of his brain removed. He ended up having a brain bleed the day after his 2nd brain surgery. He is 32 years old now, unable to work, on permanent disability and on 2 strong seizure medications to control generalized clonic tonic (grand mal) seizures he now suffers due to scarring in his brain.   This could have been diagnosed, medically treated with IVIg and high dose steroids when he was 5 reversing and preventing more damage. Maybe he would be having a normal life now. We will never know. But I do know Dr Flamini bullied me and threatened me then denied everything after his diagnosis of Electrical Status Epilepticus in Sleep (ESES) and Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) by THREE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS saying there was no possible way he had those disorders.

{"text":"Very Disappointing and disturbing non-treatment.  We brought our Havenese, Maggie, for examination and treatment of an ear infection.  We chose the emergency clinic because our regular vet was not open on the weekend.  We were initially interviewed by an assistant who took her medical history.  We waited over 2 hours before we met the veterinarian on duty. The young veterinarian explained that Maggie had an ear infection as well as bruising on her abdomen as a result of allergies. (Maggie takes allergies pills daily.) The veterinarian explained that she had not treated Maggie's ear because of \"risk of injury\" and if she put something in her ear, \"Maggie might go deaf.\"  She was prescribing an antibiotic to treat both her ear and allergy conditions.  We were promised a Discharge Summary regarding her examination and treatment.  We received Maggie's medication but were then surprised to learn she had not been given any by the vet. We asked for and received a pill pocket and gave Maggie her medicine.  We were charged $185 for the alleged examination. The Discharge Summary was never given or sent to us from the emergency veterinarian.  It was not until we got in the car that we realized Maggie's ear had not even been cleaned.  As an aside, we waited more than 10 minutes after we had paid and Maggie was officially discharged before they actually brought her to us and that happened only because my wife asked where Maggie was.\n\nWe continued to give Maggie the antibiotics Saturday and Sunday with no appreciable change in her condition. On Monday, we took her to local veterinarian.  He treated her in my presence as follows: examination of the ear, flushing and washing the ear inside and out, putting ointment inside and outside the ear, giving a steroid injection, giving a new antibotic (stated to be a better choice of antibiotic) plus one additional ointment, directions for administrating the three medications, and setting up a follow-up appointment.\n\nAfter seeing our veterinarian, we called CCVS and spoke to the veterinarian who'd seen Maggie to questioned her about the non-treatment. As she had during our initial meeting, she restated her concern that any treatment might have have left Maggie deaf.  The veterinarian added that it would have involved legal risk \"as if I'd given her an eye ointment and Maggie had gone blind.\"  Her stated overall concern was the legal liability of any treatment. We never considered legal issues or said anything that implied that.\nOur complaint is with the firm's Medical Director.  This was not appropriate, sufficient or standard medical treatment and we paid for a very inadequate exam.","target_text":"(Maggie takes allergies pills daily.)

We promised him a swim in the indoor pool. Upon arrival, there was a sign on the front door saying the pool\/spa were out of service for \"maintenance.\" Try explaining that to an autistic. The room was generously sized and our bed was comfortable, but our son's sofabed was a joke. His feet were higher than his head. The sofabed needs to be replaced. Early during the designated breakfast period, the carafe containing hot water for tea was empty. I alerted a staffer and asked for it to be refilled. I then waited a few minutes, but she never appeared to refill the carafe. A comparison: We stayed in a Home2Suites in Eugene, Oregon, two summers ago and found it lacking with its minimalist design.

{"text":"Great price for the self-service dog wash, and a good selection of items. Sometimes have pretty good sales, too. The staff are very friendly and helpful.\n\nHowever, there are 2 reasons why I am giving only a 3-star review. The first is that the dog wash area is not fully enclosed. It would be much better if there was a door (even a half-door like at Pet Valu) to the wash area to make sure that your bath-averse dog can't escape. The second reason (and main reason) is that they should really rethink their approach to the fish section. Every time I have gone, most of the tanks have had at least one dead fish in it - often several. The fish are also sometimes mislabeled and in the wrong tanks.\nIf you are looking to buy fish, you are much better off just making the drive to That Pet Place or the Downingtown Petsmart (which actually has a very good aquatics section, surprisingly.)","target_text":"Great price for the self-service dog wash, and a good selection of items.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"The AirBnB listing showed 1 rm with 2 beds and private bath, so we booked. When we received the email confirmation, it showed 1 rm, 1 bed. My boyfriend contacted the owner who said it was 1 bed per rm. Steve, the owner offered a 2nd room at a discount. That sounded good, so the 2nd room was booked. Everything seemed ok at first and I asked if he wanted me to pay for the 2nd room then or wait til the next day. Steve said we would wait. He also said he was putting keypad doorknobs on the rooms the next day. He asked how often we wanted the sheets changed and I said it wasn't necessary. After he left that night, we realized there was no stove\/oven. No private bath. Common areas were dirty, cobwebs everywhere. The doorknob on the 2nd room was backwards, so the door locked from the outside. The rooms seemed clean and it was late, so we stayed. No hot water that night and half of the next day, but it was fixed after that. The new doorknobs were never put on. He claims that we slept all day so he was unable to do any cleaning or maintenance, but there was almost daily construction happening. First, my son left early in the morning and my daughter was often with her father. There was nowhere to hang out so I stayed in my room, NOT sleeping. If I went to hang out outdoors, there were spiders all over. His listing showed that there was TV, WiFi, washer\/dryer, among other things. None were present, though he did have WiFi hooked up and an ancient TV put in (which was also dirty & covered in dust). There were no blinds on the windows, which he said weren't necessary but he would install. The front door was left unlocked and we were not provided keys. I didn't always feel safe. He also brought over an electric skillet halfway into our stay. There were no dishes or silverware, which he brought over, also halfway into our stay. We had to wash them but couldn't put them away because the drawers and cabinets were also dirty on the inside. We were given muffins for the 1st day breakfast, which molded as you can see. I would ask for clean towels but not get them until late into the evening. In my opinion, you should never have to ask for clean towels at a BnB. And I've never had to. The day before our departure, he said he'd forgot about charging for the 2nd room and said his wife would be over to take care of it. She never showed up and we ended up leaving to do some things late in the afternoon. Honestly I was not thrilled & did not plan to pay for the 2nd room, after everything. I was dreading any more interactions with him. He installed a broken washer and dryer. The dryer he said worked, but I was unable to get it working. I had to wash clothes in the bathroom sink and hang them. We were there for my son's graduation and his shirt had to be cleaned. My son investigated and found the dryer was not plugged in, so he could at least dry his socks that I washed in the bathroom sink. I also had to wash dishes in the bathroom sink. There was hardly any water pressure in the kitchen sink (which my daughter fixed, the filter was clogged). The last straw was the construction on our last night. I planned to go to bed early because we had to get an early start. I was in bed by 9pm, the construction was going on until 10:30pm. It's a good thing he did ask for the $ for the second room at that point. I was angry, frustrated and I'm not sure what I'd have said to him. I am not a mean or spiteful person and I have been stressed about this visit ever since. He left a terrible review on my boyfriends AirBnB page. It was very rude and uncalled for & he lied. He claims there were footprints on the bathroom walls. If there were, they were not from us. He said we left trash and food in the fridge. We did leave a few things we couldn't take, but I let him know. He said we were dirty, I cleaned while we were there, including dusting and getting rid of cobwebs. He said we ran the AC day and night. The first night it was turned down. He said the next day it was too cold for the other guest, so after that i kept it at 70, turning it up at night to at least 75.","target_text":"There were no blinds on the windows, which he said weren't necessary but he would install.","annotation":"unrelated"}

In any case, I'm a big fan. I think art should be accessable, both physically and intellectually, and the S&C is both. Physically it could hardly be much more accessible, sitting in a public park. Intellectually, if you appreciate it on no other level, it is hard to feel a sense of whimsical fun in an enormous spoon with a cherry on the tip of its bowl, the stem of which, during the warmer months, sprays water into the pond in which part of the Spoonbridge rests. The S&C would probably be worth a trip all by itself, but there are also great views of the Basilica of Saint Mary's and the downtown Minneapolis skyline.

I had to wear a brace and went from a wheelchair to walker and eventually a cane.  I also had to sit with leg straight out in backseat when I went to doctor or PT.\nSo glad Leanne Nutter was my PT.  Under her guidance and the therapy she created for my injury, I was able to begin the long recovery process.\nAfter being in a brace .. unable to bend knee for 3 months ,the doctor gave the ok to begin the slow incremental bending of the knee which was immobile for so long!\nI am forever grateful to Leanne for her dedication to get my range of motion back. She is competent, knowledgeable and was genuinely caring.  She answered all my questions and gave me home exercise print outs and made suggestions as to how and when I would be able to ride in front seat of car, etc and helped me meet or surpass my recovery goals.

{"text":"Summary\nI got a lemon of an apartment and I would say \"go for it, it might be better for you\" if it wasn't handled so poorly by the management and service team. In my opinion, you should avoid this complex at the moment. There are plenty of other better and cheaper options in the area.\n\nThe Apartment\nI rented a 2 bed\/1 Ba apartment. It was on the bottom floor and next to the parking lot. It was newly renovated and I paid about $1,400\/month for it.\nPros\n- Renovation looks nice\n- Garden tub\nCons\n- Thin Poorly insulated walls (temperature and sound)\n- Bad outlets that didn't hold plugs\n- Loud appliances (heater and washer\/dryer)\n- Master closet didn't match apartment layout on website\n\nThe apartment itself looked really good and 2bed\/1ba was exactly what i was looking for. It had the added bonus of a garden tub which was nice for me. However, thats where the good features of this apartment end.\n\nThe walls are thin and poorly insulated. My first week there, I was able to make out the entire conversation of someone in the parking lot at 2 am.  In addition, the bedrooms were around 5 degrees cooler than the rest of the apartment. I would hate to see how they felt during the hot Georgia summer.\nI spent the better part of two months trying to get the service team to replace outlets that wouldn't hold plugs. I ended up leaving before my lease was up and the outlets still weren't fixed. I attached a video of the problem below.\nI found it impossible to use the living room area while the washer, dryer or AC unit were running. This wasn't a huge issue for me because I didn't spend much time in the living area but if you like living in your apartment, it might be a problem.\nThis last part is a little weird. about 40% of the master bedroom closet was walled off. I can only assume that the area had utilities or something similar for the entire building.\n\nOther issues\nThe renovation was pretty shoddy. I'm not sure who is doing quality control but they should probably start doing a better job. I had a mismatched door for my cabinets. Various doors were sticky and the plates on the frames may have been installed correctly but for the most part weren't.\nThe exterior renovations were expected but what I didn't expect was a generator outside my bedrooms from 9am to at least 6pm. I'd advise you to avoid an apartment in a building that iss being renovated. Especially if you work anything but 9-5 M-F.\nThe neighbors for the most part were friendly. However, I did have issues with my upstairs neighbor. They loved to play music at midnight - 4am. Management didn't seem to care though so I guess it really wasn't an issue. I also found that they park in the handicap spots and then go move there car in the morning. This wasn't a problem for me but if you need a spot you might have issues using it.\n\nManagement\nThe leasing agents were completely friendly and a pleasure to work with. I found the Resident Experience manager was generally friendly but usually smiled at you at you and claimed she would fix the issue and then she would completely forget about it. The other manager was rude and unpleasant to be around unless he was trying to get you to do something like resign your lease. The service team just didn't do anything. I had to fight to get the outlets fixed, they didn't replace them all and they unwired the light switch from the outlets that had them and thats just a single service request. The rest were just completely ignored, including the one where water was literally coming up through the floor.\n\nConclusion\nThe apartment wasn't spectacular and I could have lived with it but the price was too high and management didn't seem to care about any of the issues I had. I thought that the issues I had were a Cortland problem but I've transferred to one of their other complexes and everything has been great. I attached pictures of all the issues below.","target_text":"I also found that they park in the handicap spots and then go move there car in the morning.","annotation":"negative"}

{"text":"I bought a 2015 Maserati Quattroporte from Taiwon of Stateline Auto.Overall the sales experience went well as I posted 3 months ago about the initial sales experience. Taiwon whom seemd like he was more interested in helping me than anyone else since we had spoken over the phone I chose  him to sell to me.This has since changed very drastically.The car windows  went out before  I got home and then the air conditioner started making noises that it shouldn't have been making.I bought this car  June 3rd  for my girlfriend.The car was picked up at my home and they did send a loaner.I want the whole truth to be told.However they kept our car close to three months total from the times it came and had to go back.The first  time for 2 months and the second  time for a few days as it had to go back.I was made promises that were  broken. I was told I would receive a check for my \"inconvenience \" basically for owning a car for months  I never  got a chance to let my girlfriend  enjoy.When it came time for the check to be sent  they sent a liability waiver  wanting us to release  them of all injury and liability  that had  NOTHING  to do with the car being gone for over 2 months and my \"inconvenience \".This was never discussed.I was blindsided.I called and talked to Taiwon and Mike whom was handling the service and explained to them I could  not sign such a waiver and I had not had the car long enough  to check for safety  and reliability. They had it longer than I had up until then.The check was sent back and I told them I would not  sign that releasing them of liability from a car I barely knew. ALSO when the car came back the first time there were multiple  scratches and blemishes that Taiwon and I agreed would be taken out by them BEFORE I would  sign off on the loan that were STill THERE and had not been touched even though the  car sat up there for over 2 MONTHS!! NO reasonable explanation  was given and it was ridiculous for a  car dealership  that advertises as a legitimate Maserati  dealer  to be so careless to a customer who  carefully chose them and was Sold by Taiwon on buying from them because  they \"Are the REAL MASERASTI DEALERSHIP\".The air conditioner  issue had NOT been fixed  even  after I was told  a custom part had to be shipped from Italy and this was justification  as to why this car was kept for so long.After this amount of time this car should have been repeatedly  checked for compliance.I even purchased a very expensive warranty.If I treated my customers this poorly i would loose all credibility in my industry. Needless to say the car seems fine now and now I want to be paid my 1500.00.check which covers LESS THAN THE PAYMENTS FOR THE TIME I NEVER HAD OWNERSHIP  OF THE CAR and I cant get a call back from anyone.Left a message  for Jason Harrill.I have left several  messages for him and still  NOT a response other than a text saying they would call me back from the salesmen.It seems everyone now is on the same page  and  now that I have the car no one will take my call or call me back After I had a check sent to me with a ridiculous  liability  waiver I rightly refused to sign.The check  should have been.mine no strings attached  and their explanation  was we had to have something signed to show you received it from Maserati.Why not  send a.LETTER SAYING BY SIGNING THIS FORM YOU AGREE THAT YOU  HAVE RECEIVED  THE MONEY  PROMISED YOU INSTEAD OF TRYING  TO TRICK ME AND GET YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ME RELEASED BEFORE I KNOW IF THIS CAR IS RIGHT AND SAFE FOR MY FAMILY TO DRIVE??I am a man that lives on his word and principles.You give me your word  I expect it honored. Now that they have my money and the car is gone I am   no longer important.

He noticed that I have mobility issues, walk with a cane, etc. then proceeded to go above and beyond to locate a unit for me near the front entrance by the handicapped parking! I did NOT request this, he just did it! Also, he should be commended for the excellent job he does maintaining his facility, it is ALWAYS clean and well kept.

We all thought we were going to see exhibits of artwork by the students at the school, which I would have found much more interesting and engaging.  The admission seems very high for the limited number of pieces on display, and I echo others' reviews pointing out that the space isn't that large and much of it was wasted.  The place needs better signage to keep people moving in the right direction (we got into an area with restrooms and exits to the outside but no way back into the exhibits without the friendly intervention of a security guard).  They confiscated our backpacks upon entry and, while their claim check system worked well and seems consistent with other art museums we have visited, it was just a bit off-putting.","target_text":"I found the artwork largely uninteresting and inaccessible.","annotation":"unrelated"}

So delicate and delicious! I could seriously eat these all the time! (Why does it seem like I'm yelling while  writing this review?)\n\nIn addition to the things mentioned above, they have specials like almond horchata. If you haven't tried it yet, you must!

{"text":"I know I'm late in posting my review for Father's Day, but I feel like better late than never.\nI made a reservation for Father's Day. We live in Colorado Springs so going to this restaurant is a drive but in the past it's been totally worth it!\nWhen I made the reservation I stated that there were 4 children in a party of 6. When we arrived they seated us at the top of the stairs in the back of the restaurant. With 4 children, sitting at the top of the stairway & far from the restarooms is not good. The table also had direct sunlight. Don't get me wrong, I love sunlight, but not directly in my face during a meal. I asked the hostess then the server, then the server again & finally the blinds were closed. The service was beyond slow! When the  waitress came to our table I politely asked her to close the blinds. She shook her head in acknowledgment of my request. I then started to order drinks. Before I could finish & without asking my husband what he would like, she disappeared. About 5 minutes later she came back with 3 drinks. There were 6 of us! I then ordered the other 3 drinks & again asked if the blinds could be closed. The restaurant was dim but I was wearing my sunglasses because the sun was directly in my face. She rolled her eyes & mumbled something about the hostess was supposed todo that. Then she disappeared again without taking our food order! She returned with the remaining drinks & finally took the food order. She was not friendly. It was Fathers Day! She never wished my husband a Happy Fathers Day. We went almost the entire meal without her coming by to see if the food was okay. We had to ask for drying refills. She brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert, which we did. She seemed annoyed when we ordered dessert making her have to redo the check. On one of the many trips to the restroom with my children, i alerted the manager on duty of the issues. She nodded & told me she'd been a server before. That was it! We were there almost 2 hours, most of which was waiting for the server to bring food\/check. The good wasn't hot when it arrived. It was basically tossed on the table. We arrived a little before 7 for our 7pm reservation & left shortly after 9! It was busy but not overly crowded.\nNeedless to say we have not been back since. I unsubscribe to their emails. It was not a pleasant dining experience & based on the server & the manager's attitude, I don't feel like they cared if we returned! Our bill was almost $150 too!\nVery disappointed!!!","target_text":"I asked the hostess then the server, then the server again & finally the blinds were closed.

{"text":"Don't go unless you have $300 to spend on an ear infection. Just left here. My first visit was nice. Had to have our dogs anal glands expressed which was $25. Two weeks later she has an ear infection (we thought she had mites) and she kept licking her behind. I said exactly that and they took it as I wanted her glands expressed again.... I JUST had her ana glands expressed. So they did that without really asking.  So that was an extra $22 I didn't authorize. Just to have my dog looked at was $52. That's fine. I don't expect charity work from a ver. Then he mentions an ear swab to see what's up. Didn't really pose it as it isn't absolutely necessary but you can do it anyways. It was posed as we need to do this. That was $25. Just to swab her ear and look at it under a microscope. Who knows if they'll actually do it and if I'll even hear results back? Because nothing was said before I left. I only had $70 to pay.also, the vet mentioned dog good to buy for her possible allergies. $100 for a bag of dog good. Which is completely jacked up on price because you can get it online for $60 for a bigger bag. C'mon. So they automatically assume I'm paying this much for food seeing I have 3 kids in tow. I love my fog and I want her to eat healthy, but 100 for a bag of food is absolutely ridiculous. And then to come at me and pressure me saying I'll carry it out to your car, without asking if I even want it?!? No. Then I go to pay and its 170. I wasn't expecting that do I said can I pay $70 today and the rest tomorrow. We get paid tomorrow. Usually vets I've worked with in the past will work with you if you need tome to pay the bill. I was asking one say. Then a lady from beyond says with a bit of am attitude did you not know you only had $70? Way to make me feel like crap. We are saving for a home and all of our extra funds go directly to that savings account. Its not easily accessible for a reason. So yes I knew I only had $70 for my dog.

{"text":"Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City is always  a pleasure to work with. My husband and I have been lucky enough to work with the entire dealership staff for over a decade from sales to service. The professional staff delightfully welcomes me and my entire family into the dealership each time we are there as if welcoming us into their home. Mercedes Benz is the pinnacle of product standard in the automotive industry and exploring with excitement the various makes and models enhances the experience we have with each Mercedes Benz we order. Working with Tim Allred who provides meticulous expertice and ultimate perfection in ensuring our cars are ordered exactly how we prefer. Tim is straight forward and easy to work with. He exudes his love Mercedes Benz. Tim is passionate that not only to you get the best vehicle for your needs but will always surprise me with providing flawless and expectation surpassing service. He spends ample time learning about me and my family to ensure we get the perfect vehicle and love that vehicle through the entire ownership of each vehicle.  His kind, caring and honoring interactions makes the buying each new MB a fun process.  Ron Clemonts and John Collins in financing is a true joy to work with each time. Both men create a smooth and seamless process to getting the paperwork buttoned up in order to quickly get us enjoyig our new Mercedes Benz. Josh Collins has been our service advisor all these years attending to each of the cars we have owned. Josh is wonderful at being accessible to me to ensure an easy process when bringing any of our cars in for service. Frank is always ready to go with a loaner so drop off and pick up is a breeze. Josh keeps me in the loop when any of my cars is being serviced. His suggestions have always been vital and successful to keeping our cars operating at the best performance level possible. He is spot on with tackling the correct issues and my bills are according to the estimate or less than expected. Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City has provided my family with MB's for over a decade and taken care of each one as if they owned them personally. Each staff member takes pride in providing a level of service that goes beyond a basic client\/dealer relationship. It is truly a family at MB OKC and from the Managers of Sales John and Service, Cecil to the drivers and ancially staff everyone knows our names and cares about providing exceptional service that exceeds expectations. The attention to every detail creates a personal customer service level that is far more than the automated car buying experiance buyers have come accustem to in the industry today. It is genuinely boutique shopping for cars and we love it. I am writing this review because even through all of the good times the dealership is even better when issues arse. Currently we are working in colaboration with the service department to handle a performance issue with a current car we have.  Cecil Simms and Randy Bednar have both been actively involved with the goal clearly marked out that they care about resolution of the issue even more than I do myself. It evokes confidence knowing how much they care about things in the difficult times.  It isn't easy to deal with the issue with such integrity and pose. Knowing how the dealership has rolled up their sleeves and chosen to do the dirty work to ensure my husband and I are happy is remarkable. It is the moments like these that reveal the true character.  I would say after over a decade of buying Mercedes Benz from MB OKC we couldn't be happy with the tremendous working relationship developed.  When I read negative reviews it is unfortunate that those isolated events happen  I would say look at the incredible time and care that goes into responding and seeking resolution. It is what MB OKC does. It is their character to exceed the clients desires. My husband and I respect and enjoy the marvel of engineering that each Mercedes Benz demonstrates. Karl Benz would be proud to hang his script \"The Best or Nothing\" at Mercedes Benz of Oklahoma City","target_text":"Josh is wonderful at being accessible to me to ensure an easy process when bringing any of our cars in for service.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"P\"LEASE DO NOT IGNORE THIS REVIEW\" This is one of the most dishonest, uncaring dealership there is. It will be a long read but you will thank me if you don't get a vehicle from these guys. Let me start off by saying i wanted to give 0 stars but couldn't. First ignore their star rating cause the practically force or bribe you to give them 5 stars before you even finish purchasing or test driving tge vehicle( that's if they let you test drive it cause i couldn't) they will respond saying all kinds of things about me and stuff, BUT i will back up what i say with video and recordings from the start of our dealing, cause i record everything on my phone for extra proof just in case. And yes I'm willing to let anyone who's interested to hear and see my recordinds. Let's begin. I disabled with anxiety, depression and other issues. I've been disabled for 6 years now trying to get my life back. I live in brooklyn Ny. My wife got a good job i Orlando Florida where we have been planning to relocate. I decided to buy her a car for when she leaves. Saw a nice car at this location for $3,995. I only had $2,600. My credit is not so good, i am on disability so he helped finance so i gave him the $2,600 down payment. Everything looked good, right away he asked for a 5 star raiting. Coning me on how he helped me get finance. I signed and asked for copies of the contract, he said they will email it, which they never did. The financing place emailed me with the total which was over $6,000 including the interest. My payments nade was 0. So i went in the next day ti ask about the $2,600 i gave. He said since i was financing the value of the car is now over $7,000. So a $3,995 car is now worth close to $10,000. I didn't understand so i said it made no sense i preffer to borrow some money and just pay cash. So he helped me with that and now i owed $2,000 and change. I gave him $1,000 and owed $1,000. He said he can give me 30 days to pay but i explained it would be hard for me if i can have 45 days. He said yes but isn't responsible when the tags expire in 30 days. I signed a 30 day contract cause he said he cant give me a contract for 45 days since my tags expire in 30 but we have a verbal agreenent on the 45 days. Well i 4 times if rhe car was in condition to go to Florida, they said it was just inspected the car is more than capable to go and return. Well the car broke down 3 times in the highway with my kids in there. The car is currently not in service. When i returned and told them they didn't ecen care just asked for the money i owe. Now on recording i have a worker telling me that tgey don't even check the oil. Tgey buy at an auction and sell as is. Another employee told me he was quitting cause they are too dishonest. They promised more time to a lady and lied about it to take her car. And that's another thing that happened to me. I only brought $400 in 26 days and they didn't even want to honor the 45 days they gave me. Me being disabled i couldn't control my tears from coming out. It's the 3rd of july and i came in to finally pay them and get my title. They lied to me about a registration issue and when i protested he moxked me by saying you were hear crying the other day. Really! Making fun of a disabled person. I told him u know I'm recording you. He just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. So as i was walking to the bus he asked me with a smile, \"you don't have a car, you walking\" like he was mocking me cause he sold me a defective car. But please don't take my word for it. I would gladly let anyone hear and see for themselves. Oh also the price hike on the car, one of the workers showed me on the computer my contract and also didn't understand why the car went up so much. He asked not to say what he showed ne, but unfortuanally i have to open peoples eyes. DON'T BE FOOLED BY FAKE RATINGS. Keep in mind i gave 4 stars too soon cause i felt he was helping me. If this is how they treat a disabled person, imagine how they will treat you, your parents, your kids and your friends. Don't waist your hard earned money here.","target_text":"I disabled with anxiety, depression and other issues. I've been disabled for 6 years now trying to get my life back.

{"text":"Have been harrased by my illegal grow neighbor for years. Neighbor kept moving property line over and over. I moved it back where the court house states he has a easement through my property. Officer leiss?  refused to look at history with this neighbor who has set my yard on fire the day before court almost 2 years ago. Refused to look at our history saying it's not his job.  After interviewing neighbor twice about fire sherrifs office claimed his story was the same. It was not. Same neighbor has purposely broke my water line 3 x in the last few weeks. Sherrif office will call me about me moving property line but not do a thorough investigation on the fire? Will not tell neighbor to stop purposely breaking my waterline. Meanwhile neighbor grows more weed then he is supposed to and they bust him, yet never give him a fine. All it takes is driving by to see the light pollution at night or check his 600$ electric bill. Please do thorough investigating and look at the history of restrainting orders and legal battles. That should be considered. Instead they back this criminal with a long history. Do a background check and you shall see. I feel Same officer Leiss descriminated against me because of my being female. When I told him I can't go to my waterline to see damage because I have a bad leg he thru it back in my face when I asked that I be able to take my fence apart. He replied \"I thought you couldn't walk\" no sir I can walk down my driveway! I can't go up the mountain. He wouldn't let me finish my sentences and put words in my mouth. Being discriminated against for being disabled and a woman is not part of your mission statement. I'm very disappointed with this sherrif and sargent who was on duty today. Both did not look into this neighbor who has lied repeatedly.  Not ok to discriminate against partially disabled people and women. Not ok to have these two yell at my boyfriend who is more like a female over the phone. Demanding we get a game camera and place it in a area that is not my property to catch neighbor messing with our waterline. Also sure enough this neighbor broke my fence in to pieces just how i knew he would. Thats after he apparently lied to you claiming I layed a hand on him?

{"text":"The River House Caf\u00e9 was always a favorite of my families growing up in the Sarasota area.  When they were closed due to Covid, we were all very sad as we went there almost weekly, however, we were excited to see that Mila\u2019s had taken over the location. Upon entering into the restaurant, we were greeted by a very rude waitress who although we had been waited on her before by the former restaurant, I just made an excuse for her behavior thinking that she had just gotten through a very busy lunch rush. We were then sat down and another party of 4 about 10 minutes later sat down next to us. The party of four was greeted as we had not even been asked our drink order or given menus. We again decided to overlook it as we thought you know what this is a new restaurant maybe they were just really busy for lunch and so we just proceeded to wait and have our order taken. This is where our visit takes a pretty bad turn. I had my daughters service dog who had not been qualified for a service dog until recently.\nThe very rude waitress (red hair), then says\n\u201cOh I remember your dog well, she snapped at me previously\u201d. The thing about my dog is she\u2019s very kind loving dog but when she senses emotions off of people she does tend to be very protective. We did however work with her diligently on this and she has been an amazing service dog for my daughter who suffers from PTSD. My dog also protects her, and that is a part of her service to my daughter. Continuing on, we order our food, and the food comes out and they had brought clam chowder with no clams and All bacon in it. My daughter who was actually going to eat the soup cannot and does not like bacon and so I asked politely if they could exchange it because it does not say in the menu that there is bacon. So I had some and over a gentleman that work there, and the first thing he does is act very rude to me, and says hold on a moment and returns and says there is no bacon in that soup. I then proceed to show him the pieces of bacon in it and he reaches in front of me and my dog growled at him. Well first thing he says is that is not a service dog, I have never had a service dog do that, I\u2019ve never seen a service dog like that,  and he was raising his voice in front of the entire restaurant. He then asked me what she is a service dog for, because of the way she acted, which violates the American disabilities act, as he is not to ask me what the service dog is for. He then asked me if I have her card which I had not had her card, as everything was packed in our luggage heading out of town. Now mind you this was to celebrate my great aunts 93rd birthday, and the way we were being treated was unacceptable. I then tell him you know what let me speak to your manager, he then says to say he is the manager which surprises me, because you\u2019re the manager and you don\u2019t know that you have bacon in your clam chowder? Then the waitress chimes in and  says all clam chowders have bacon in them, which is not true, New England clam chowder, a true clam chowder,\ndoes not have bacon in it.\nHe then turns around and says under his breath get out of here, and says our meal is comped and just leave. So basically what we are looking at here, is horrible food, and service. The chowder that they did bring was watery no clams, full of bacon, and a manager who obviously does not know his food.\nWhat we are dealing with here is Hippa violation, discrimination, lack of knowledge of menu, and lack of knowledge of service pets. And extreme lack of professionalism. The way we were treated is completely unacceptable, and if he is the manager, not the way a manager should treat patrons. I have worked in the restaurant business and design hotels and restaurants all over the country for over 20 years before I became a nurse. I have never in my life experience such a complete  lack of professionalism, and rudeness. I will be contacting the appropriate entities to further this matter.

{"text":"We arrived at 2:10 PM on a Saturday, when they're advertised closing time is 5:00 PM. As we were approaching there were several, (6-9) museum employees carrying boxes from the museum.\nWe were informed on entry there was no charge for admission, which seemed great, at the time.\nOur first stop was the fluid dynamics interactive demo. (Shooting plastic balls from a tube using air flow generated by dropping a bowling ball inside a tube.) There are two or three of these devices, and there was ONE ball. Not to mention it's a safe bet to assume it will be fired into another part of the museum. And it was. So, my 6 year old was upset, as well as another child that walked in to find he couldn't try.\nThis pattern continued, most exhibits had no instruction, explanation or description and almost all were incomplete. And more than half weren't functioning properly or were turned off by staff.\nDespite the fact there were several families during this time staff was almost completely inaccessible. Those that were visible were fixed entirely on closing everything. In fact, the only other staff member to speak to us was a teenager moving items on a cart to an elevator.\nIn several rooms it was near 80 degrees. The areas around exhibits didn't appear clean or sanitary.\nAt 4:31, there was an announcement that the time was 4:35 and the museum is closed.\nI would have preferred to be informed that due to circumstances the admission was free, prior to arriving, as I did call and check online.\nIt was not worth the time, regardless of price.","target_text":"Despite the fact there were several families during this time staff was almost completely inaccessible.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"One of the best places in the bay area for hiking, biking, or to go visit with farm animals. The trails are well marked, and most of the reserve is accessible for kids as well. The kids will love Deer Hollow Farm where they can get close to goats, sheep, pigs. All in all a beautiful way to disconnect from the Silicon Valley and always on internet... And get closer to nature.","target_text":"The trails are well marked, and most of the reserve is accessible for kids as well.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"My mother was sent to The Atrium on Alps Road directly from Chilton Hospital.  I correct myself.  She was sent to THE GATES OF HELL!  The staff neglected her so severely, lied to the family, were rude, uncaring, unprofessional to say the least.  She was released in the monstrously worst condition than ever imaginable!  Heart medications were ceased, no effort was made to maintain healthy nutrition (she hadn't eaten in at least five days) nor to hydrate her (\"She wouldn't drink\").  I am a lay person and I am well aware of methods to hydrate a patient!  She was released in a marginally vegetative state (she was NOT like that when she was sent.  She needed physical therapy, medication for bacteria and an infection, heart medication.  She had been intelligent could converse BEFORE the liars and thieves (collect insurance money and bounce victims, oh, should I say patients?) out.   Totally incoherent, raging with bacteria and infections, dehydrated and malnourished, The Atrium released her to the family.  She could not move from a wheelchair, was not aware of her surroundings.  Now hear this...The Atrium, if you crawled at the speed of a toddler is a five minute trip from there to her home.  If you used a motor vehicle, perhaps two to three minutes are needed.  Marilyn, at the Atrium had the audacity and ignorance to respond, when asked how my mother could be released in that condition:  \"Oh, she was fine when she left, she must have gotten that way on the way home.\"   REALLY?  So, a UTI, Bacteria in the Blood Stream, total neurological deficiency can overwhelm an individual in less than five minutes?  Finally, it was admitted that her last evaluations were performed on August 31, 2020.  She was discharged on September 5, 2020, with NO EVALUATION, UPDATED TESTS AT ALL!  After the transport (Atrium's), leaving her at home with family, in  roughly twenty to thirty minutes, having to use the bathroom in her home, she could not even place one foot on the ground to mobilize.  911 was called, the Police stated that problems of this nature occur regularly from the Atrium.  Admitted to Chilton, from the emergency room to testing,  it is confirmed that the Atrium set her back enormously.  So, the Atrium is paid to murder patients?  She may never see home again!  The Atrium was trusted to care for a patient, not neglect, ignore, act with nasty vengeance.  It is not up to the Atrium to create a HELL to torment patients.  The Atrium is disgusting, vicious, should be investigated closely for incompetence, dishonesty, laziness, unprofessionalism.","target_text":"She could not move from a wheelchair, was not aware of her surroundings.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"We come here for the location and accessibility.  Staff is great and they have daily\/ nightly activities going on for guests. My Son enjoyed making s'mores and playing in the game Room. We had a lovely family vacation.  Only downside (that has already been mentioned) is that the rooms are a tad dated. Windows are single panel and let in cold air.  Thankfully the heater works great.  Beds are mostly comfortable, but the couch in our suite had a tear. So not the most luxurious place to stay, But pretty roomy. Kitchenette is lightly stocked with pans, cups and silverware.","target_text":"We come here for the location and accessibility.","annotation":"unrelated"}
