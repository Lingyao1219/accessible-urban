{"text":"I\u2019d give 0 stars if possible. I took my car here because I had used them previously on another car two years ago; they were good back then, but have since gone down hill.\n\nWhen I dropped the car off on a Wednesday morning, I told them I needed the car back by Friday because I was moving. I was told, \u201cOk.\u201d They \u201clooked\u201d at it Friday afternoon, and said there was nothing wrong with it. I knew they were either wrong or they hadn\u2019t really looked at it. I asked them to look at it again. By 5 o\u2019clock Friday (they\u2019re closed on weekends), they said my car needed a new clutch. No, really?\n\nI got them the part and dropped it off on Monday morning. They didn\u2019t start working on it until Tuesday afternoon! I was supposed to move the next day. They called me late afternoon and told me my car now needed a flywheel. Where the Hell was I going to get a $1,000 flywheel at the last minute?\n\nAt that point, there was nothing that could be done except tell them to put the car back together. They charged me $300, because obviously I have that money to waste on NOT getting my car repaired. I had to rent a uhaul to move. Now, I have to get the disabled car towed to Florida, where I moved. Then, I have to pay someone else to take it apart and fix it.\n\nI should\u2019ve looked up the reviews before I took my car there. I doubt they even care about their low rating. They\u2019re a bunch of lowlife crooks and scam artists. They\u2019re unprofessional and liars. Save yourself money and a headache and find a more reputable shop to take your vehicle.

{"text":"It's been a couple years since we've actually stayed at this campground. When we returned and we registered it felt like we hadn't left everybody was very pleasant. Check-in was easy.\nGetting to our trailer was also easy the map was very easy to understand.  When we got to her trailer we were quite impressed the only suggestion would be just a hair bit more in between to be able to fit a car in between the two trailers. So we had room for both of our cars.  yes there is a spot you can pull in front of but that's also where you had your fire ring.\nThere's plenty to do with the kids even though we didn't utilize any of it we did walk around. Activities for the kids to do, two pools one for families in one for adults wish I would have brought my bathing suit. People in general all-around were friendly the permanent campers that drove around in their golf carts were extremely friendly.\nThe reason we had to give this a four out of five and the only reason is because at night where our trailer was is right next to a car dealership and their lights were so bright it was hard to sleep. We had the window blinds closed we even put blankets and sheets over it but it was so bright. The only suggestion we make is doing blackout curtains for the back room.\nOne small suggestion which is not a make-or-break deal is maybe have a list of the little things you need to bring.  It's hard to know what to being as different campgrounds provides different things to know exactly what you need to bring. such as a scouring pad so I didn't have to go to the store and buy one would have been nice to know.\nAlso if you are a light sleeping the office said they have ear plugs I would make sure to get a pair.\nMy kids are already talking about doing this again next year.","target_text":"We had the window blinds closed we even put blankets and sheets over it but it was so bright.","annotation":"unrelated"}

I explained that was fine but I was concerned about my work schedule and the time they needed to do the job. I was told I would have my car back by 14:00 \/15:00 at the latest if it was dropped off by 0930 (which it was.)\n\n14:00 approaches I haven't heard anything from them all day. I called and was told they needed about 2 more hours. Okay...what choice do I have?\n\nI got off work at 16:00, I called again and asked the progress. I was told about another 1.5 hour and they would call me back from there. I waited until 16:30 then i headed up there.  Got there and it was still not done but it was being finished up.\n\nI went to check out and was told the machine was down and cash would have to be spent...no one ever mentioned I needed to bring cash luckily I had cash so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nLastly the following day Nov 10th I went to my car in the morning for work and noticed the ignition\/\/ key hole is no longer lined up the way it should be!! So now I have to go to GMC and spend more money to have it put back in the right spot. I tried calling traffic jams today Sat.Nov 11th but they're closed.\n\nThe remote starter works but the hassle and lack of customer service and concern for my time sucked. I wouldn't recommend traffic jams if you're needing your vehicle before 9 hours...if you expect them to keep in contact with you.\nHopefully they will make their right wrong and put the steering wheel cover back on properly and I won't have to go to GMC and spend more money.\n\nI highly recommend getting a part time receptionist for appt scheduling and helpful info like bring cash our machine is down.

{"text":"I went to Our Lady of the Snows to destress  and to be in peace AND to walk around and learn something. I loved it. This was my first time actually walking around the grounds instead of driving around looking at holiday lights. This a religious place based in Catholic faith. I didn't mind as I love to learn regardless of what religion it is. I went to the visitors center first to get information on how to navigate the grounds. The ladies in the gift shop were very nice and cordial. They gave me a map of the grounds and let me know that its best for me to drive to explore the sacred areas instead of walking the entire grounds unless I really wanted to walk several miles. I decided to drive and get out to explore and walk around. The sites were amazing y'all. I saw various monuments, statues and sacred areas as I drove around. The last area I drove was the death and resurrection of Christ where each section had a speaker that would tell you it's story and how you can use the principles to live your daily life. It was very peaceful here and I felt God here. This was definitely a spiritual journey for me today at Our Lady of the Snows. I did see several deer while driving around and they didn't approach me. Instead they moved further away. I had never been to a religious shrine or place like this and was amazed at everything I saw today. I learned a lot about the Catholic faith and Jesus Christ. This campus includes a hotel, restaurant and chapels all on grounds that anyone can stay and experience. You can rent spaces for events as well. Throughout the year Our Lady of the Snows be host various events and activities to serve the interest of many. The most popular is the holiday lights display.  This place is family friendly and wheelchair accessible. The only thing for wheelchairs would be that the streets on campus are gravel roads so it may be difficult to navigate a wheelchair. Do be careful. I'd suggest driving instead of being wheeled. There's various parking lots throughout the campus that are paved and a wheelchair would be fine on. Going here it's free to explore and enjoy. They do ask for donations at various places such as the prayer candle areas that were a suggested donation of $3. If you don't have it still feel free to enjoy, but at some point purchase something or make a donation when you're able. According to the information I read about Our Lady of the Snows, the order provides services and programs to the poor, underprivileged and handicapped in  more than 60 countries across the world. This campus had beautiful flowers, plants, trees and lawns. No matter your religious preferences, this is an amazing site to see and experience.\n(For video walk-throughs of this beautiful site check out my YouTube channel.)","target_text":"This place is family friendly and wheelchair accessible.

My entire educational life I have had incredible difficulty with math while getting good grades in other subjects. On the advice of family and friends I've decided to have myself tested for a possible learning disability in this subject. I looked at reviews for different assessment centers in the area where I live. The Texas Center for Educational Testing had the best reviews. I also like that they test people of all ages not just elementary and high school students like some assessment centers I researched.\nWhen I contacted The TxCet. I had the pleasure of meeting Stacey. She's a Educational Diagnostician. She was informative and scheduled my testing for 2 weeks later so I didn't have to wait long. During my assessment she was professional and incredibly patient. I also had the pleasure of meeting Mona who is also a Educational Diagnostician. She gave me some great ideas for enhancing my analytical way of thinking.

{"text":"Purchased a 2015 Honda CBR1000rr from Xtreme Honda through salesman Dave Wick. It was a sight unseen internet deal although I received many pictures of the bike. Dave assured me there was no damage or issues other than a few minor scratches on the right side.\nI purchased the bike and had it shipped. Upon receiving the bike I found it was damaged far beyond what Dave had let on including a bent handlebar, repainted (with a spray can) fairing which also had bondo and broken tabs. A severe oil leak, the rear brake light switch was disabled, the radiator mounts were bent, the right mirror had been jb welded on, there were zip ties holding the fairing on the bike, the rear wheel had damage, the engine casing was damaged and had been spray painted, and the oil filter was dented all over.\nI contacted Dave at once who said he would get with his service manager and see what they could do. THEY DID NOTHING !!!!! Not a single call back despite calling the owner as well as Dave.\nI live in Michigan and they are about five hours away or I would have sent the bike right back to them. To date it has cost me over $1500 to repair all the damage Dave claims he never saw on the bike. Even his service guys didn't see any damage when they SUPPOSEDLY went through the bike. Dave did agree the damage was there when I sent him pictures of all the issues.\nI WOULD NEVER DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN!

{"text":"We recently booked a reservation for the On the Creek cabin through Parkside Cabin rentals.  During the initial booking we should have been leery about this cabin and overall approach since the cabin location is not disclosed on the website.  We arrived at the Parkside office in Gatlinburg to check-in.  We subsequently are notified that the cabin is located 13 miles outside Gatlinburg.  OK, not ideal but maybe this will be a location with nice scenery and seclusion from the hustle and bustle of Gatlinburg.  WRONG!  The cabin is located near an abandoned shanty and a large RV park.  As well, the cabin is near the highway so instead of hearing the trickle of a creek you hear highway noise.  Therefore, the cabin has no outdoor beauty and thus the drive is completely void of any value for this cabin.  This cabin should not be booked if one is expecting to enjoy the Smoky Mountains from the cabin porch.  One can book this cabin and enjoy a view of a dilapidated junk house next door.  The pictures on the website strategically miss showing the poor location of this cabin.  Definitely not ideal but maybe we can close the blinds in the cabin and just use the cabin for a place to sleep.  Again, WRONG!  The bed in this cabin is the worst we have ever experienced.  We have slept on hotel beds throughout the world, slept in Army barracks, on the ground camping, and on the floor and have been more comfortable.  The bed makes horrible noise if either person moves in the bed at all.  As well, the mattress must be the cheapest thing ever since it is like one is sleeping on the box springs without a mattress.  Now, we have a bad location for a cabin and we can\u2019t rest.  The couch is the next option to try for sleep.  No surprise, the couch is complete junk in relation to any comfort value.  We were slated to stay in the cabin for 3 nights but decided to cut our stay short by one day.  We drove back into Gatlinburg and arrived at the Parkside office.  We notified the office that we were leaving a day early due to the poor sleeping conditions in the cabin.  At this point, the Parkside staff said \u201cOK\u201d and scribbled something on a sticky note.  Nothing more was said and they took the keys.  There was never a sorry, or how can we make this better, or any type of expression that they valued our business.  If Parkside would have shown some level of care in this situation we would have left with a much better opinion of Parkside.  Unfortunately, we left the Smoky Mountains tired from lack of sleep and have a bad taste in our mouth for Parkside.  Think twice before booking this cabin and be leery of Parkside if you do have any issues with your stay.","target_text":"Definitely not ideal but maybe we can close the blinds in the cabin and just use the cabin for a place to sleep.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I did a club fitting with Zach last summer and it was an exceptional experience. Zach took his time not only finding me the best club heads, but also the best shafts and grips. I never felt rushed and not only did he find the best equipment for me he also took the time at every step in the process to listen to my feedback and explain to me what we were looking for and why. He accounted for not only the stats the Trackman gave him, but listened to my feedback as to what felt right. Additionally, when I was satisfied with the results I was seeing he continued to tweak things a bit to ensure these clubs would be the best clubs for me for years to come rather than many shops that want to get you in and out and don't really know how to assess what is best for you or seem to even care.\nMonths later Zach checked in on me to see how the clubs were performing- I let him know my driver stopped performing out on the course to the standards\/consistency we were seeing in the fitting. Zach invited me back in and worked with me as a golf coach to correct some bad habits I had created and get me back on track.\nSince then I gave my wife a fitting for Christmas and she experienced that same great level of service and attention I did and walked out feeling better about her golf game with some new shafts. I was amazed Zach assessed her swing and never tried to sell her something she didn't need or over-sell her on the \"latest and greatest\" equipment that based on the data wasn't necessary.

There have been times as a parent I have been at a total loss on what to do with the ways I have seen her act and James and Ray both have been right there to help. Not only to offer advice on how to handle the situation but also how to correct my own habits to help correct hers. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone!\n\nWith that being said, I have also read previous reviews. My only advice would be, don\u2019t be blind to what Martial Arts is.

{"text":"Lived here since 2013. Property has really gone down.  The upkeep of the apartments has declined. Not happy, will be moving out as soon as I can. Gave it 1 star only because it\u2019s walking distance to metro and free garage parking but that\u2019s it.. Neighbors aren\u2019t frendly, prices are low for some of the apartments, but the building and care-taking overall is below average. The walls and ceilings are extremely thin.  I\u2019ve complained about the people above me who stomp and bang nonstop day and night. Nothing has been done about it and this has been going on since I moved to another apartment in the building, more than 8 months now!! However, I live alone and am only home 4 days out of every week for the same 8 months, and I\u2019ve received unfounded noise complaints! Noise from what? I\u2019m hardly ever home and it\u2019s only me! It\u2019s a combination of cheaply thin walls and inconsistent unfair treatment.  As of late I\u2019ve seen some bugs in my apt. which seem to be coming in through cracks in the crown molding. I was told by maintenance that I would have to wait until the next week for them to be patched up.. huh? Then the pest control rep. put sticky pads down! All of it is Ridiculous!\n\nAs a side note because of this and other overall issues where I am dissatisfied. I inquired about moving out early and one of the stipulations is to pay a one month rent penalty fee!  Look at other options before living here. They obviously don\u2019t appreciate long tenure tenants as well as the lack of care in looking after the property and other matters I have deemed unfair above.

{"text":"Discrimination\nA friend of mine. The situation as told by a former teacher of hers... my former student who graduated with honors from a local high school and is now at Cal Poly recently applied for a barista position at Tribe Coffee House in Arroyo Grande, Ca recently. She wanted to work at a small business and liked the vibe. She obviously impressed them at the interview as they hired her. She did not disclose her visual impairment during the interview as it did not come up naturally (and is not legally required to). At the end of her first two hours training with the manager, she casually brought up to the manager how great it was that the cash register was electronic and therefore, very visually accessible. She then shared that she was visually impared and the manager was very sweet and said they could accommodate her. Upon arrival at her next scheduled shift she was met by the owner and the manager and asked to explain her visual condition, which she did. The owner then gave her a series of tests to do to evaluate her vision. The only task she was not able to complete successfully was to read the measurement on a clear measuring cup filled with water and devoid of any contrasting markings from over 3 feet away. (I remind you she is visually impaired and I don't think I could do this accurately with normal vision on a clear measuring cup from a distance.) However, she gave the owner strategies that she would use to ensure that she had the correct amount in the cup including memorizing each level and visually confirming it before inserting it into the espresso machine. The owner then informed her that they would be removing her from the week's schedule and that she could go home and they would do more research on her visual impairment. The owner called her the following afternoon and informed her that the position was not right for her and that it might be a good idea to apply at Dutch Bros. or  Starbucks where they could accommodate her visual impairment.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this situation is that the owner did not even give her a chance and set her up to fail. My student had and shared strategies she would use and they were disregarded. She wasn't even given the opportunity to demonstrate how she could complete the task! Additionally, it seems Dutch Bros and Starbucks are better able to provide measuring tools with readable print on them than this small business and allow the individual to hold the cup where they can see it. I find this hard to believe. The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) protects employees of business with more than 15 employees. Since this business does not meet this criteria they are exempt from the same standards and can do as they please. So it seems that in the eyes of the law this sort of treatment is legal but it certainly does not make it right or ethical. A marked measuring cup doesn't sound like an undue burden for a small business to provide for an accomodation. This makes me sad, frustrated, and disappointed.  While I\u2019m certain that in the owner's mind she was just trying to reduce her own perceived liability and possibly ensure my students safety based on very limited information, the owner lost out on a great employee. But worse yet, she gave my student her first life lesson in employment discrimination  due to her visual impairment.","target_text":"She did not disclose her visual impairment during the interview as it did not come up naturally (and is not legally required to).

We Lived in the mid-rise building where it is served by parking garage. The garage gates always broken.  You have hard time to find a parking spot. Besides there is long walk to your apartment. So if you buy groceries, you have to carry them for a long walk. There are only few parking spots available for guests. Each time that we had guest, we really embarrassed with parking conditions. Besides, it was simply not possible for them to find our apartment as the the hallways are very confusing for new people. So we had to go get all the guests from outside.\nThe apartments are too dark that we had to turn on the lights through day time. The walls are too tiny that you can hear what your neighbors doing in their bedroom.\nThe office staff are really unprofessional.

Supplements of all types, natural health care products.  Fresh seafood and meat choice counters.  Hot buffet style dishes and soups (before covid interfered.) Pizza counter.  Sandwich and burrito counter. Self-fill filtered water station. Excellent dairy and non-dairy choice selections.  Gluten - free selections of food, along with the usual choices.

I checked my voicemail and saw she had left a message the at 9:13 am, and the scheduled appointment was the SAME DAY at 10am! It's obvious the girl in the office just didn't want to work. How unprofessional to cancel an appointment with that little notice.\nHowever,  since I haven't seen the message I went to the location.\nThe girl in the office opened the blinds and kept pointing at the number when we arrived. When I called the number that was on the door, nobody answered the phone. So I knocked again and I told her that I had an appointment. She could have taken 2 seconds to open the door and tell me and my girlfriend what was going on, but didn't even have the decency to do so. She just kept yelling through the closed door. She then explained that the appointment had been cancelled. However, It was obvious I had not received her message since I was at the door! Furthermore, she said that they were only doing virtual tours. WHAT A JOKE! THE REASON I MADE AN APOINTMENT WAS BECAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE A VIRTUAL TOUR FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS!

{"text":"So, I usually do not like to leave bad reviews, but my last two experiences here have been awful, and since I chose this dentist based on great reviews I thought I should share.\nSo 6 months ago I took my 15 year old daughter to an appointment, I was sent a text before that due to covid to call once you arrived and someone would come out and get you, so I guess they were behind that day and we ended up waiting for about 40 minutes! The hygienist came and got her and she was done super fast. My daughter came out and told me that she felt they really rushed on her cleaning etc. Also they gave her a fluoride treatment that I did not agree to and insurance does not cover.\nAnyway I decided to stay here and took her today for her cleaning appointment (usually get there about 10 minutes early). They have a tiny parking lot with 4 parking places and 1 handicap parking place, and a sign that says additional parking in the back. There was no parking in either (happens most of the time) so I had to park at Wal-greens across the street ( had to do plenty of times). So since I didn't get a text saying to call once there and someone would come and get you, I attempted to call to ask if that was still the case and that we were at Wal Greens, however it went to an answering machine, so I told my daughter I would just drop her off and she could call if she needed me. You can only make a right turn into the parking lot, so I had to stop by the median to let her off so I could go and turn around. She called me and said that there was a 8X10 sign on the door that said to wait in car or call for assistance, so she called and she said they rudely told her there was a HUGE sign that said wait in the car and they would come  get her. The door was locked so she was waiting outside for me to come get her. The person that answered the phone said since it was a nice day she would come to Wal-greens to get her. I canceled the appointment and we will not be returning here.","target_text":"They have a tiny parking lot with 4 parking places and 1 handicap parking place, and a sign that says additional parking in the back.","annotation":"neutral"}

The account manager for Yard Butler was there that night and witnessed the crash. Out of the kindness of his heart he immediately decided that he would have some of his guys mow and maintain our lawn for free for the summer. Nobody ever asked them to step up and help us out; the company just simply did it and did it in a huge way. There was no way that I could have taken care of our lawn and my wife had to work a little extra to make ends meet so she hardly had time either. It was so awesome not to have to worry about the lawn with everything else going on.

{"text":"My partner and I booked a 48 hour pass with Top View.\nAs you will see there are many varying opinions of Topview - our experience was overall a good one.\nYou are looking at $90-ish for a 48 hour pass, which by every day logic isn't cheap, but you are in New York City after all and paying for a tourist experience. Even with that being said, I found it to be good value for money, when you consider that you have access to most parts - if not, all places that a generic tourist could want to go to. I found the cost to be best value for money amongst similar packaged bus tours that I was looking at.\nThe highlight of our package was the 'Liberty Boat Cruise', it was a thoroughly enjoyable excursion; a 2 hour boat tour of the water side areas of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The tour guide aboard, Wesley is a New York native and provided a thorough, very enjoyable and insightful narrative to New York's history and the city as we know it today.\n\nCons;\n1. There is no live tour guide aboard buses. There is an audio guide which is accessible on board buses and earbuds are supplied by Topview.\n\n2.

{"text":"Updated Review 10\/24\/20:\n\nMe and my husband purchased a sliding door with built in blinds\/roll screen and a custom front door with side lights. Has been a very frustrating, months long process that is still not finished at this point in time. We do not feel any product is worth the hassle this has brought us. This has been a series of people blaming each other and no one taking accountability. This is the timeline of our experience:\n\n5\/2\/2020- Show room visit, selected our doors\n\n5\/3\/2020- Submitted our financing approval to our sales consultant\n\n5\/19\/2020- Pella came to our house. Finalized payment and measurements. Called to schedule installation on 7\/6\/2020.\n\n5\/31\/2020- Notified by our sales consultant that our entry door has been delayed due to COVID shut downs. Rescheduled to 8\/17\/2020.\n\nWeek of 8\/10\/2020- Received a call from Pella scheduler to let us know that our front door again is delayed. Claims that she has absolutely no way of tracking our door in the process of manufacturing. she has our sliding door, but she wants our project to be in one day for the crew. Rescheduled to 8\/28\/2020.\n\nWeek before 8\/28\/2020 received another call from scheduler. Again wanting to push out our installation. Informed her that we want our sliding door installed and do not want this to be continued to be pushed out.\n\n8\/28\/2020- Installation day arrives for sliding door. Never received a call with ETA, Pella crew just arrived around 9am. Crew fights on scene and sends one guy home. Botched molding is put up to replace our current molding (included pictures attached). Black scratches all over interior of door. Did not have our roll up screen and had no clue where this was.\n\nEvening of 8\/28\/20- Send pictures to our sales consultant because we are upset about the quality of product that we received. Was told that the manager would be in contact with us with a credit back. No idea why our screen is not delivered as there were no inventory issues with this item.\n\n9\/1\/2020- Project manager comes to our house to inspect our sliding door that we were upset about. Able to clean off the black marks from door. Remeasured the molding and agreed all of it would have to be taken off and replaced. Really nice guy. Plan was to fix molding when our front door was installed.\n\nSilence from Pella for a few weeks. 2 more installation dates in September get post-poned again. Still no idea where our front door is in the process of being made and scheduler has no idea where our roll up screen is. We keep rescheduling because otherwise we get no updates from Pella. Post-poned installation to 10\/8\/2020.\n\nReceive call from scheduler as our 10\/8\/2020 installation nears again. We tell her that we want our roll up screen installed still. She states she will notify the Project Manager that we want our screen installed still.\n\n10\/8\/20- Again no phone call on our installation date to confirm. No one comes to install screen. Receive no phone calls.\n\nEvening of 10\/8\/20- Send an email to our sales consultant again to let her know that no one arrived to install our screen. She states she will look into this in the morning and let us know what happened.\n\n10\/9\/20- Husband tries calling Pella around his lunch break. Calls 3 times and each time gets hung up on when requesting to speak with our sales consultant. Emails sales consultant and gets an immediate response. Gives his cell phone, but she never calls. Instead the manager calls him to discuss our dissatisfaction with Pella.\n\n10\/13\/20- Manager calls to inform us that they are installing our screen 10\/14\/2020.\n\n10\/14\/20- Crew who came the first time returned to install our screen and fixed interior molding. We were upset that the crew who fought and did a poor job was sent back when we requested that they did not. Project manager comes. Remeasured the front door and said the one ordered in May measured an inch shorter than it should have been.\n\n10\/22\/20- Receive a call from the scheduler. Front door is pushed out another 6 weeks. Likely not getting the door for the foreseeable future and unsure when we will get it.","target_text":"Me and my husband purchased a sliding door with built in blinds\/roll screen and a custom front door with side lights.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"This review is based off of my experience. The apartments are nice.  In my opinion what makes the apartments nice are the exterior design, spacious utility area, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, and faux wood blinds (they are the cheap brand though as they bend easily). The tenants are pleasant as well.  Each person I have encountered has been super friendly.  There is no noise a seems to be a community of professionals and good mannered individuals.  Very safe. Locations is great.  360, 161, 121, I20, and I30 are quick get to.  It's also almost right next to the police department. Walmart, Kroger, Outlet mall,  and a few restaurants are up the street; you do not need to get on the highway to get to them.  Parking is unacceptable.  As I have stated every one who lives here is super friendly. The parking situation is what will probably be the reason that many tenants do not renew their lease from the brief conversations.  The apartments are two pricey for tenants to have to pay to park and for their visitors not to have a place to park.  The reason I say tenants have to pay to park is for one to secure a place to park they have to have a carport or a garage. I felt really bad for one tenant as they moved here because of parking issues at their previous community. When they initially called they were advised that parking would not be an issue. No one can park in the complex unless they are a tenant. This is unheard of. Basically people cannot have company as they have no where to park.  Visitors are only allowed to park outside the gates and that is like maybe ten or so slots. Many people purchased garages and carports to secure them a spot.  However they are only allowed to park in their spot that they pay for.  The free spots are for those tenants that opted to not pay for a garage or a carport.  Many tenants have garages and carports far from their building.  So because one opted to pay for a spot they can never park in front of their building.  This completely sucks when the weather is bad, or you have to run to your car late at night. It's like you are punished for paying for a pot.  I think if people are paying extra they should be able to park where they choose. Yes, there are still garages and carports available and I do not think tenants that made a choice to pay to secure a spot should be excluded from any spot. I think the tenants that have carport and garages in or by their building should be allowed to park in spots BY their building. The garages are over $100 a month. I was extremely disappointed in how management handled this. I think all tenants who signed their lease prior to when the new laws were reinforced should have received some form of compensation.  Three months free for their garage or carport or for the remainder of their lease or the option to break their lease when they found a new apartment. Force may not be the right word, as they did not have to but considering the circumstances many were forced to get a lease. Living somewhere that makes it almost impossible to have visitors is absurd.  This situation was just sprung on tenants with no options or remorse. It was just like hey, this what it is and will be. Purchase a parking spot or risk going without one.  Staff. The staff is pleasant for the most part.  They really are.  They are not your superior customer service but they are not outright rude. I would say a they possess of lack of compassion, you know if it does not have a direct negative impact on them they not going to worry with it.  They do what's needed to get the job done and move on. The parking situation and how it was  handled ruined it for me. I understand situations occur that we do not foresee, but you take responsibility and accommodate those affected.  if you want a nice place, I do think these are the nicest apartments in the area, I would say go for it, if having visitors is not a deal breaker living here can be enjoyable.","target_text":"In my opinion what makes the apartments nice are the exterior design, spacious utility area, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, and faux wood blinds (they are the cheap brand though as they bend easily).","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I actually like living here! At first I was very nervous of moving in because of all the bad reviews i had read!\nHere are the negatives:\n-when i moved in some things were missing: one of the blinds in my room (so i requested for a new one and they brought one in a week later).\n-maintenance can sometimes take long to respond (a little understandable because there are so many units here and if you've ever lived in an apartment, you would know A LOT of apartments are actually like this).\n-Yes hallways can get a little stinky but thats only on weekends when the trash guys are not here so what do you expect?? FYI trash shoots are in a room on each hallway so that is why it can get stinky.\n-guest parking can sometimes be packed but only have had a problem a few times\n- had an ant infestation in my bathroom but pest control came and sprayed in down and has been good ever since.\n\nThe positives:\n-the rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and nice. The imperial is perfect for 2 people!!\n-The washer and dryer inside the unit is awesome\n-the staff is really nice\n-free breakfast, pizza, and other foods on certain occasions\n- i requested quiet neighbors and have had no problems with noise at all.\n- the apartment is making a lot of improvements ever since i moved in! a lot of renovations have been made.\n\nOVERALL, I do think the positives outweigh the negatives even though I've had problems with maintenance here and there.","target_text":"-when i moved in some things were missing: one of the blinds in my room (so i requested for a new one and they brought one in a week later)..","annotation":"unrelated"}
{"text":"Awful experience. Went there for just for an x-ray of my lower back. Didn't want to go to go so had taken a pain pill at 10am. Arrived a little after 11am. The whole side of my left face was swollen. I assumed I'd fallen but it was possible I had a had I a seizure. They were totally focused on the pain pill I took. If I wanted drugs would've I  have told them took 1? I couldn't stay awake for the whole 6 hours I was there! Never asked for drugs! Just a x-ray of my lower back. What did I get i get? X-ray of my foot (I have Lymphedema so they was swollen, and hurting and I had trip day before) and x-ray of shoulder because it was sore. They did a CT, how old are there?, on my , back, which will show NOTHING, and one on my head. That won't show a concussion. This was at 10am Tuesday morning, it's now 2am Thursday morning, I was checked out at at 3pm and didn't have a ride yet. They told me I could stay in the bed until they needed it then I'd have to wait outside. I didn't get any check out paperwork. I was so confused I couldn't find the bathroom twice. The one lady I asked if if I was OK, no I wasn't. I was 4 hours into pain pill and this has never happened before. Lady trying to use wheelchair didn't know how to put it in park, grabbed the back of back of pants effectively giving me a wedgey right where I thought I broke my butt! I've had back surgery right above that. I should've just gone to Gateway! I have horses but I was dirtier after I left there! There really need to mop floors, clean handicap rails, and not shake dirty shirts! Coronavirus lives on sheets 2-3 weeks so with them shaking them those curtains are holding it just as long!

{"text":"I went to Final Draft for happy hour on a Thursday.  There was not a very big crowd but those that were there included several families with small children who were actively playing with the house bean-bag game.\n\nTheir selection of housemade beers were quite extensive and there were quite a few available for the $5 happy hour special, several unfortunately named for personality disorders.  I chose the Obsessive Compulsive IPA and it was very good, very hoppy and medium bodied, however, I might have felt different about it if I had a family member who suffered from OCD.\n\nI also ordered the Steak Happy Nachos which, unfortunately, did not make me happy.  It seemed like something you would get at a bowling alley, decent meat but the chips were covered in the type of \"Nacho Cheese\" that comes in a big can from one of the major food distributors like Cisco.  My waiter, Jacob, asked me what I thought about the nachos and I told him.  He then offered to bring me some of their house made beer-cheese dip made with their Miso Honey ale.  It was complexly delicious and tasted like real cheese.  I used any chips that weren't drowned in the melted cheese food product to dip in the sauce.  Jacob then offered to bring me a fresh bowl of chips which was just what I needed.  I also ordered the Super Colossal Onion Rings and they were great.\n\nAs I sat there I noticed that my server was not the only one who gave excellent service.  This impressed me and made me want to go back and get one of their delicious looking burgers that I saw other people enjoying.  Jacob also gave me a sample of his favorite beer (called \"That's What He Said\") which was a smart way to insure my return visit.\n\nThe restaurant is diabled-friendly with a large ramp outside and plenty of wheelchair friendly tables.","target_text":"The restaurant is diabled-friendly with a large ramp outside and plenty of wheelchair friendly tables.","annotation":"positive"}

{"text":"People with overflowing carts are allowed to go thru self-service cash registers at the Sylacauga, Al Walmart, causing those of us with 20 or less items to have to wait and wait forever. I have witnessed a lot of theft due to this reckless Walmart procedure. There is no way that any Walmart employees can monitor these thiefs, and also assist others who have computer issues at the self-service registers. There is absolutely NO REASON for a customer to have a cart full of one hundred items of clothes and food, to ever be in the self-service lines. There is not space to accommodate so many items. There must be a limit of NO MORE THAN 25 ITEMS AT SELF-SERVICE REGISTERS. ALL OTHERS MUST BE RE-DIRECTED TO CASH REGISTERS WITH WALMART ATTENDANTS. Doing so will reduce Walmart theft, reduce costs to customers caused by theft, and will allow lines at self- service registers to move quickly, which is the purpose for self-service in the first place. I have seen a husband with one cart and his wife with a second cart, with 6-packs of drinks dangling over the top of carts. This practice must be stopped by Wal-Mart.

I explained that I was trying to find a doctor as I had just moved here and my old PC doctor would be happy to speak with Dr Beltre at his convenience. I was assured that this would all work and made an appointment. When I arrived at the office, rather than greeting me, they just looked at me. I told them my name and my appointment time and they ask d for my insurance card. I explained again I was waiting for approval of Medicaid from the state but was willing to pay fair this visit after I had had a chance to spend some time with the doctor. I was handed a clipboard and told to go fill it out. I finished the paperwork and waited. I was not called so I finally asked if I could keep it to go over it with the doctor. I had been there, by then, over 45 minutes.  I was told I couldn\u2019t keep the paperwork that the receptionist needed it.

{"text":"Louie\u2019s Backyard Cafe (upstairs cafe)\nWe popped in on a Thursday about 5:30pm without a reservation. The main level restaurant & patio had a 4-hour wait but the greeter told us the cafe upstairs was open seating. We climbed the flight of stairs to find a cute space with a wall of about 6 individual mini balconies, each with a table for 2 overlooking the ocean. Inside, there were several larger tables for parties of 4, 5, 6. A small bar in the far back had angled seating set up to accommodate two parties of 2.\nThe cafe was already abuzz at 5:30pm with the only available seats being at the bar. We took it - the host even accommodated a disability by getting us a different barstool from a closet that had a back support. \ud83d\ude4f\nOnce seated, we discovered the menu of tapas - small plate items for sharing. The bartender, Zack, offered up some excellent descriptions of several of the items we had questions about. We settled on four tapas to share - the perfect amount for the two of us, however it didn\u2019t leave us room to share a dessert. Our favorites of the night were the Skirt steak tacos with fried avocado and the Bourbon BBQ bacon wrapped crab stuffed shrimp. We left full, happy and impressed by the service.\nOn Friday, we talked about the food and experience we had at Louie\u2019s Cafe on numerous occasions. When dinner rolled around, we decided to go back to try a few different tapas. Same crew working, same great service, this time with our own little \u2018private\u2019 balcony table for two that came with complementary non-stop expansive views. This night, we started off with the daily special salted caramel popcorn (a different chef-designated feature flavor each day). Freshly popped corn, still hot with a salted caramel glaze we ate with a fork. It practically melted in our mouths. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever ordered popcorn in a restaurant before but I immediately regretted not ordering last night\u2019s feature flavor. With more help from Zack, the Vietnamese shaking beef, curry-fried cauliflower and Red wine braised short ribs followed in perfect succession. Key Lime pie rounded out our evening with a spectacular glimpse at the sunset off in the West.\nSaturday, we decided early on we were going back to the Cafe for a third night in a row to try a couple more new tapas and re-live a couple of our favorites, along with whatever popcorn the chef was cooking up today (black pepper & honey). Again, same crew and same excellent service and we were thrilled to get immediate seating at the bar.\nI don\u2019t write a ton of reviews, but Louie\u2019s upstairs cafe deserved a proper one. If you\u2019ve read this far, cross the finish line by getting on over to Louie\u2019s Cafe (on the second floor!!) and order some popcorn. And while you\u2019re at it, tell Zack and the cafe crew we said hi!","target_text":"We took it - the host even accommodated a disability by getting us a different barstool from a closet that had a back support.","annotation":"positive"}

{"text":"DO NOT LIVE HERE!! We lived there for 5 years and in that time we had so many things go wrong. We had bed bugs (which we had to treat ourselves), we had roaches several times, we had sinks that were backed up for days, a pipe burst in our kitchen...and that is only a few things that happened during our stay there. The manager at Parkway is rude, loud, and blames everything on the owner of the place. If there's an issue, that's who she blames. They have you sign a one year lease and then they rent month to month after that, they wouldn't let us sign a new lease. When they gave us the notice that they weren't going to extend our tenancy there, the reason they gave is because my son left his bike on the patio and that's against their \"rules.\" After we moved out, we got a notice from them that they charged us for everything in that apartment. We got a bill for almost $2000. I expected to lose my security deposit because we have small children and there were a couple of spots on the carpet and a small hole in the wall, but I never expected that. Some of the things on the list included $500 for carpet (which wasn't new when we moved in, and we steam cleaned ourselves when we moved out), $80 for the vinyl in the kitchen (also not new & the maintenance men damaged it when moving out a refrigerator that didn't work), 6 hours of cleaning at $20 an hour (we cleaned very thoroughly when we moved out & the place wasn't clean when we moved in), mini blinds that weren't damaged, the piece of crap vertical blinds (that weren't broken when we moved out, but just so happened to be after they went through it), among other things that weren't new or in need of replacement. We asked to walk through the apartment with the manager, and she agreed. She didn't show up to our first meeting and at the second she said she would remove a lot of the unnecessary charges. 2 weeks later we got a notice that the full amount that was supposed to have charges removed from it was going to be placed on our credit report. Needless to say, we will be scheduling a court date in the near future.","target_text":"Some of the things on the list included $500 for carpet (which wasn't new when we moved in, and we steam cleaned ourselves when we moved out), $80 for the vinyl in the kitchen (also not new & the maintenance men damaged it when moving out a refrigerator that didn't work), 6 hours of cleaning at $20 an hour (we cleaned very thoroughly when we moved out & the place wasn't clean when we moved in), mini blinds that weren't damaged, the piece of crap vertical blinds (that weren't broken when we moved out, but just so happened to be after they went through it), among other things that weren't new or in need of replacement.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"The staff was very friendly, but the whole place smelled bad. The bedding in our room was outdated by at least 35 years (fake suede-cloth). Worst of all, THEY DO NOT CLEAN THE TOILET, SINKS, SHOWER, OR TUB on a daily basis!!!! Only once every THREE days!!! All they do is make the bed, and replace any towels you leave on the floor. There was NO BLANKET on the bed--just a sheet and a rather grimy bedspread (the fake suede). The bedspread as though it had NEVER been washed. The hot tub in the pool area was disgusting! It had a gray\/black ring around the entire thing. It smelled awful, despite the overwhelming smell of chemicals it exuded. The whirlpool bathtub in our room didn't look much better. We couldn't use it because there were no grab bars anywhere near it. (We will be reporting this fact to the proper authorities.)The tv had 4 remotes for some odd reason, and a hand-written note that read \"please use Charter remote.\" (Why don't they throw the other 3 away???) Oh--a maid knocked the remote off the nightstand when she remade the bed with the dirty sheets, and she just left it there for us to dig around behind the headboard and find. The room had an intercom that led to nowhere, and a remote control for a fan that did not exist. The heat control was not marked--we had to guess where it was (and what the odd white knob was forfor after trying to figure out how to turn down the heat in the smelly, stifling-hot room. The fireplace (gas) had a timer. Shortly after the flame shut off, we heard a loud BANG as a piece of the fireplace trim launched itself into the air. The towels (you only get 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and two washcloths, although the towel holder was made for more), were a sickening shade of tan. They obviously never saw bleach. There was no grab bar in the shower, either--another reportable fact. The lamps and blinds were old, cracked, and dingy. The two upholstered chairs in our room were grimy--disgustingly filthy. Also obviously from 1980. The door to the back patio area had broken blinds on it. There were only TWO hangers in the closet. We stayed during some cold days in early April, so once we hung up our coats there were no hangers for robes, sport jackets, dress, etc. There were 2 towels that were to be used for the pool--JUST TWO. If you want to swim more than once a day, you either have to use wet towels or dry them at your own expense in the laundry room. The door to the room had to be locked with a key every time we left. Not very safe, as there was no chain on the door or any extra security to keep the maids out if we didn't want them to come in while we were sleeping. There was no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, either. There is NO breakfast or food of any kind served in the morning. (I'm sure the restaurants in the area like that.) Coffee is out in the morning, but disappears before afternoon. The place needs extensive cleaning--lobby, carpets, rooms, pool, hot tub, EVERYTHING-- and a serious refurbishing of linens, chairs, tables, EVERYTHING!","target_text":"The lamps and blinds were old, cracked, and dingy.

{"text":"Having stayed at many Marriott properties around the world The W used  to be one of the higher end properties. That no longer seems to be the case here as we had problems from the start. We decided to have a little getaway for Labor Day and just unwind. We had a confirmed early check in and yet we got there around 1300 and our room still was not ready. After it was ready we entered to a rather warm room and turned down the AC. When I checked the balcony I noticed the door did not secure properly and it was allowing external noise in. I called down to the lobby and explained and was told it would be fixed. It was never fixed during our stay. When we went to take a shower the curtain pull chain didn\u2019t work and again I called down and was told it would be fixed shortly and again it never was. When we went to the pool it was quite nice. The bartender and management seemed very relaxed to the point they were allowing people to bring in outside drinks which is against the law. The TABC frowns on this quite a bit but with the COVID-19 rules going on I understand them being a bit more lax. The bartender never once came out and spoke to anyone asking if we would like a drink like they normally do. Instead he sat inside fiddling with his mask most of the time we were there. The pool was nice and seats were spread out. Aside from two ladies that kept smoking out there one of whom was a \u201cresident\u201d so she could do whatever. Things were great until a large group came to visit their two friends who were there. They all looked college age and acted like your stereotypical frat boys. After awhile we left and went to dinner, when we returned just before 2200 so we could have a drink but the bar was already closing down for the night which seemed odd since there was a large round table that had several people there. We had a late check out confirmed and yet our keycards were still deactivated before we were to check out. When we were checking out we tried to use the remaining balance of a gift card we had and neither the desk clerk nor the manager knew how to do it. There negative things were no robes in the room, the door to the balcony didn\u2019t secure properly, the bathroom pull chain for the blind didn\u2019t work, allowing people to bring in who knows what in styrofoam cups, and we couldn\u2019t get a drink from the bar. The positive things were we had a great view, comfortable bed, and a very clean room. When we were checking out we were asked if we enjoyed our stay and I said no we did not they just went right past my answer and checked us out.

{"text":"There is a lot that is really nice at the Woodlands. The setting is lovely, with streams and pretty grounds and nature all around. But there are some things to be aware of before you go. It is necessary to navigate stairs to get to everything - the pool, restaurants, the nightclub, and probably even your room. There are lots of stairs, skinny windy hallways, greenhouse-like walkways enclosed in plexiglass. It's like a big maze if you don't know the layout. If you don't want to haul your luggage up and down stairs, either get a room in the \"tower\", which has an elevator, or ask for the first floor. We got a handicap-accessible room on the first floor. There was a little patio (but a step down so not sure how a wheelchair could get to it). And the room was tiny! Definitely impossible for a wheelchair to even get in the room. The bathroom had a high toilet and a sink that you could pull a wheelchair under, but it had a regular bathtub. I don't see how they can call it handicap-accessible. And since all the restaurants are flights of stairs away, I guess a handicapped person could sleep at the Woodlands, but not eat there. Or get room service? All the staff were great, very nice and accommodating, except for the snotty desk clerk who lectured us regarding how they have a firm policy on no early check-ins. Everyone else was great.

I was impressed by the thoughtfulness. Some of that quickly wore away however as I, a large man was barely able to fit into the narrow wheelchair. They really need the wider style as many older people are overweight. Anyway we were cordially greeted by a lady who asked what my interest was. I told her I wanted to see what they could show me in massage recliners, having purveyed the website through the early morning. Lenna Finch cheerfully asked us to follow her to 3 floor models. I tried all 3 and the cordial Ms. Finch quite knowledgeably answered all my questions but one without help. The sole  question, she quickly found the answer to after a brief hiatus. While trying out the controls of the 3 it quickly became apparent only the Easton model met my height requirement with my feet touching the floor. After checking stock, Ms. Finch quickly wrote a receipt for the chair. My only regret was it would take 10 days before delivery. Two days before my 65th birthday. A wonderful present! Much thanks to Ms. Lenna Finch. I highly recommend her. By the way, this is my 2nd La-Z-Boy massage\/heat recliner.

{"text":"The dentists we have seen there have been nice and worked well with our children.  However, making it through their administrative staff is not worth the hassle.  In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic our children had appointments that were scheduled at the same time.  At the time, our children were 2 and 3 years old.  Prior to our appointment we visited the website and read, in detail, the precautions and safeguards put in place by the practice in light of COVID-19.  We were happy to see it being taken seriously.  At this time the guidelines for their practice was \"one adult per child.\"  My husband and I arrived with our children and attempted to check them in for their simultaneous appointments.  We were met with hostility and outright rudeness for even suggesting that our children require one of us to be with each of them.  Their administrative staff insisted that only one of us could enter with our 2 and 3 year old children for appointments that were to happen at the same time.  This meant one of our children would be left to see the dentist alone.  A scary prospect for a child, let alone a child of that age.  I was made to feel like I did not care about COVID-19 guidelines and made to feel like I was being irrational.  I repeated to them that their guidelines read \"one adult per child\" and not one adult per family; and expressed that we made sure to read their guidelines prior to arriving so that we could follow them.\nEventually, the  rude female we were speaking with came back to the phone and said something like the \"doctor says it will be ok\" with disgust in her voice.  We enter the facility with each of us taking one of the children inside.  We felt awkward after the encounter to say the least.  As we suspected would happen they took each of our children to separate rooms for their appointments only confirming that one of our children would have been left alone had the rude female on the phone been successful.  The appointments with the doctors went great.  There was no issue there at all.  Upon leaving we were ask to schedule their next appointment.  THE LADY SCHEDULING THE APPOINTMENT ATTEMPTED TO SCHEDULE THE BOYS AT THE SAME TIME AGAIN.  I SPECIFICALLY SAID WE COULD SCHEDULE AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND DIFFERENT DAYS IF THEY HAD ISSUE WITH ONE OF US ATTENDING WITH EACH CHILD.  I OFFERED TO ADAPT TO THEIR UNWRITTEN POLICY. I was told that it was not a problem and that the situation would not happen again.  Six months later (a few days ago) I call the day before (instead of reading) to give the office the boys new insurance information as we had received text messages to process information for the boys.  These texts and forms made it seem as if the boys had never been there before, so I called for that reason also as it seemed strange (and I had mistakenly entered some of the information incorrectly since the form was only accessible via text message).  I ask if the forms could be emailed because it is hard to fill out so much information on a phone (it was several forms).  I then ask if we needed to fill out all of the forms as these forms seemed to assume the children had never been there before and the practice should have most of this information already.  She said they have changed software\/programs and lost of the previous information and they are having to start over from scratch with each patient, and, again, the only way to do this is by text message.  This was aggravating but I was willing to deal with it.  I then pointed out that our children (now 3 and 4) have appointments scheduled at the same time and wanted to verify that one of us could bring each child in so neither of them would have to be alone (and explained it was an issue before and that I was told it would not be an issue again).  This is where the female speaking on the phone became defensive, again.  She said they changed their policy and it  now reads \"one adult per family\" and that only one of us could attend with the boys.  In short, they expect either a 3 or 4 year old to do this alone.  Appointments were cancelled. Never returning.","target_text":"These texts and forms made it seem as if the boys had never been there before, so I called for that reason also as it seemed strange (and I had mistakenly entered some of the information incorrectly since the form was only accessible via text message).","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Updated after 3 1\/2 years of living here: So far, it has been a  less than a decent experience here at the complex. Daniel and Cathy have probably been the only part of the positive experience I have encountered here at the Reserve. Going on my third year and I'm already looking at other apartment complexes that are worth the money because paying what they charge here is surely not worth the hassles. First complain I have is the PARKING. I have to come home from work late at night to find people who are not residents parked on resident parking making me have to drive all the way to the back of the complex to be able to find parking. Last but not least,  for the third day in a row, there has been a problem with the remotes to access the security doors that allow the residents to go into the apartment complex. I went in to report it to the office staff and before I could finish speaking I was rudely interrupted by her and was told we know about it, maintenance is working to fix it. Today I had to step out of my apartment and the issue still had not been resolved. I called the office to ask how was I supposed to access my apartment and was told that it should of been fixed already and surprise, it still hasn't. Then I was told by the agent that she would have to come up to the front to let me in through the gates in order for me to be able to get into my apartment and then she calls me a minute later to tell me her remote is not working neither that if I want to access my apartment I would have to go through the parking gates like herself had to do. Completely disrespectful and unacceptable. Resuming my somehow detailed review. The apartments are ok but definitely not luxurious. They are many other apartments near by that are 5 times nicer for exactly the same price. I will be moving to the Sanctuary at Eagle Creek as soon as my lease is up. After complaining to the leasing office and getting a call from their unprofessional higher up female manager I have to express I\u2019m less than satisfied with the condition of theses apartments. One of the crystal glass covers from the top lights in the entrance corridor almost landed on top of my 2 year old daughter all because of failure to keep the apartamentos up to code with safety. I did not even get an apology for that incident, mind you those glass covers are pretty heavy and we would be having ourselves a pretty legal situation here. I\u2019m the kind that I ALWAYS AND ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS DOCUMENT THESE TYPE OF INCIDENTS. Let\u2019s make it clear: I TAKE MY CHILDREN\u2019S SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY. Another thing, they have blinds old school style with string hanging far down for opening and closing them which can ALSO BE A SAFETY HAZZARDS FOR CHILDREN due to the fact that there have been cases in which children have suffocated themselves because they started to play with the strings and they ended up wrapped around their necks. I made the work order to have them changed to newer ones they are using for their newer units which they have been renovating and I was told because they already had replaced some of them that I needed to pay for them replacing the others. I guess because this isn\u2019t about their children, it\u2019s not IMPORTANT enough to pleasing one of the few good tenants they have. It is unfortunate that it has come down to this level. Hey by the way, if you want better units how about paying a higher rent for the renovated ones. I mean, you\u2019ve only invested about 4 years with us, so your loyalty and respectfulness to the office management and following all the rules and guidelines of the community ,your proper actions aren\u2019t good enough to be valued. As if I don\u2019t pay higher rent already to be able to live in a Lake Nona community they want me to dish out even more money because their investors just can\u2019t get enough $. All that is valued here is $$$ and how much more are you willing to spend. When I first moved here, it was pretty decent, now it\u2019s just another community getting invaded by circus clowns whom don\u2019t have the decency to respect the rules and regulations making this complex a joke.","target_text":"Another thing, they have blinds old school style with string hanging far down for opening and closing them which can ALSO BE A SAFETY HAZZARDS FOR CHILDREN due to the fact that there have been cases in which children have suffocated themselves because they started to play with the strings and they ended up wrapped around their necks.","annotation":"unrelated"}

Also, shared parking lot with many businesses and a local bar- beware if parked too far, too late at night! (there has been drunk people doing donuts and hit\/run vehicles).

The lobby seemed nice and the view was great right on the water and a short ride to the strip. HOWEVER- within the first hour of being in our room the glass shower door in the master suite shattered into a billion pieces. None of us even touched it. so that leads me to believe that it was previously broken or improperly installed. It looked new when we got there. Upon calling the front desk they sent up a manager and eventually a guy to clean it up neither of which seemed shocked this happened. One woman even said \" This happened Again?\"  We had to call the front desk multiple times to have them re-clean the glass shards out of the bed room and bathroom I even cut my foot open. waiting for them to finish cleaning we moved to the other bed room only to find out the toilet would not flush. We were informed they couldn't fix it and we would have to remove the back of the toilet to make it flush.  THEN ( because yes there is more) we found roaches in the kitchen and even BIGGER ones out side. All weekend could smell cigarette smoke through the AC vents.

It's pretty much the only option for sit down hibachi service in the area. 3 days ago I went with 2 friends and had a $250 check before tip without alcohol. It's good food, but it isn't that good.\n\nTonight, my best friend had flown in from San Antonio to support me as I just found out my wife has cancer. He wanted hibachi, so we went.\n\n3 days ago, our table was separated by plexiglass for social distancing measures. Tonight, although there were clean, empty tables we were sat at a table with a family of 6 with no plexiglass divider. I guess social distancing is only serious when the virtue signalers deem it serious.\n\nI was sat at the corner of the table. I elected to sit at the boot part instead of the chair. I'm 6'4\" and have back issues. The booth is far more comfortable. Since there was no divider, this also meant when I talked I breath away from the family we were sat with.\n\nThe hostess told me I could not sit in what amounted to the exact same place. She told me I must sit in the chair. In all seriousness, Its a toddler's chair. They're uncomfortable. I'm WAY to large for these things. I expressed this. I was then harassed by an incredibly rude, short, unattractive, deaf, incompetent manager. I dont say these things to be mean, I say them to be descriptive of who did this.\n\nShe put her hands on my shoulder and told me, \"I had to move or else.\"  I laughed at this underhanded threat and asked with profanity what would be done. Would she physically move me? She said, and I quote, \"Oh, f*ck you.\"\n\nThe family we were sitting with told us a story about how they were forced to leave 2 nights previously because of some virtue signaling as well.\n\n5 minutes later a police officer arrived and told me that my business was no longer welcome. I was also told if I did not leave that I would be arrested for trespassing. As we were leaving, the officer decided for no reason to put his hands on me. This was the 2nd person to put hands on me.\n\nI've spent thousands of dollars in this restaurant. It's now my mission to relieve them of hundreds of thousands of dollars of business. Unfortunately, people never know who they are dealing with... all over 12 inches.\n\nI left and went to the restaurant I received incredible service and food the night before... we did a little less the previous night....\n\nLooking forward to it Kobe...\n\nPS: A few nights ago when here, I noticed the manager, TONY, offer the table beside us free alcoholic drinks if the patrons would all leave a 5 star reviews. This was offered to my table as well. We declined as we do not drink. No judgement, just a personal decision.\n\nBut, yall free drink them right out of all their profits!

I had a car reserved and paid for, arrived after the time I said I would be there, and was told that they were out of cars but would put me on a waiting list, or I could pay an upcharge for another vehicle that they did have available. I was traveling with a handicapped woman and a 6 month old baby, and we had to wait in a crowded waiting room for a car to become available while our luggage sat outside in the rain. There were multiple people there with us that were in the same situation. Once we actually did get a car the CD player was broken and made a horrendously annoying clicking noise nonstop for the duration of our trip. The building was small, cramped and dirty, customer service was horrible and the employees were rude.  Worst experience I've ever had with a rental car company... Or any company really.

{"text":"Neighbor complaints are not taken seriously. I have a neighbor that keeps putting laundry on the patio. The lease clearly says not to do so. I have taken pictures and e-mailed them to the office and still nothing is done about it.\n\nCommunication with management\nI do all my communications by e-mail. There have been times I did not get a reply back from management. Also the property owners have changed a few times. The current owners do not give out their e-mail to tenants. On their website they have a phone number listed however you can only leave a general message. There is no receptionist. I left a message once and never received a return call. I e-mailed the assignment manager at the Villas at Bailey Ranch and asked about a e-mail. She alleged to not have one for the corporate owners.\n\nValue for what your getting\nIt\u2019s not too bad but I would not pay too much more in rent because of the appliances.\nLet me explain. I have a family member that works at Whirlpool. The appliances in my unit are made by \u201cHotpoint\u201d. Those are the cheapest appliances Whirlpool makes. Also my building is not new. The blinds are plastic. Across the street Tall Grass has stainless steel refrigerators and name brand cook stoves. Also they have wood blinds throughout the whole unit. I have a friend that lives over there. She had a problem with a tenant and management took care of the problem.\n\nKeeping the property up\nFrom my understanding the grill by swimming pool has been down for a long time and one tenant went round and round with management. They refused to fix it.\nThere is not enough maintenance for the size of this property. The property does stay clean. However the trash cans between buildings 17 &18 overflow with trash on most weekends because there is only one trash can. Management put two then they decided to remove one so now there tends to be trash sitting on the ground.\nThe cheap washer of my upstairs neighbor floored her apartment and my unit. My ceiling was damaged. It took almost a month for my ceiling to get repaired because they do not have enough maintenance. Then the assistant manager tried to get over on me and have me use my renter\u2019s insurance to pay for damages. When this was caused by that cheap Hotpoint washer malfunctioning in my upstairs neighbors unit. After contacting the manger things worked out.\n\nThe business center is a joke. The computers work for about ten minutes then crash and they are very slow. I once went in the office and there was a new staff person. I asked her to fax something for me. The fax number was printed at the top of the document. She was politely but seemed nervous about sending a fax. Well long story short she did not not do it correctly. I had to go to the Owasso Library and the staff there are great. My fax was sent in no time and they e-mailed me the confirmation.\n\nReviews\nI\u2019ve lived in the Villas at Bailey Ranch for almost 3 years now. I read a lot of reviews before I moved here. Many were very bad. Then people started posting saying the apartments were under new management. I decided to give them a chance. A friend of my decided to wait for Tall Grass to get built. A co-worker and her family lives in the Villas too. They are unhappy too. Whatever complex you look into. Take the reviews serious it will save you a headache. Also know the name of a good attorney and get a copy of the Oklahoma Landlord Tenants Laws.\n\nPrivacy\nThe bedroom doors have no locks and for the amount of rent your paying they should.","target_text":"The blinds are plastic.

{"text":"Horrible establishment. First impression, TERRIBLE.\n\nLet\u2019s start with registration: They failed to mention that Valet parking was available so now we have to pay for parking. Computer wasn\u2019t working in the registration office so we had to go to another location to finish registration. The place isn\u2019t wheelchair friendly at all btw.\n\nStem Cell Clinic: Waited FOREVER to be seen by the stem cell doctor. Vitals were never put into the system for the PA to observe. Waited FOREVER to be transferred to the ER. Get to the ER to wait even longer to be seen by anyone. Stem cell clinic never communicated anything to the ER regarding our arrival. No communication between staff at all.\n\nER: Finally in a room, took almost an hour for someone to come check on my husband (that\u2019s to include the nurse) and even longer for IV meds to get started for the level 9 pain he is currently having, still waiting on orders for scans. Some of the equipment in the room didn\u2019t work. Nurse failed to check on my husband and took FOREVER to finish preparing for the IV. The wrong information was written on the white board in our room. This place just doesn\u2019t seem to have their stuff together. The Dr. told my husband he would receive hydration fluids...an hour passes still nothing so we call the nurse and come to find out, the Dr didn\u2019t order fluids because there\u2019s a shortage on fluids? How does a Dr. write down exactly what my husband will receive but forget to put the order in? The nurse stated he would follow up with the doctor but disappeared again. Finally, the manager of the dept spoke to us, and it seems like things are coming together now. Other than that, no one has come to check on us and update us on anything. The doctor finally came back and was like \u201coh I forgot about the fluids\u201d...so unprofessional. Then she expected us to remember what time my husband received his pain meds via IV, when that\u2019s the nurses job to chart and brief the doctor on. This place is just completely out of order and unprofessional. I am very disappointed in this establishment. I work in an ER and this is the worst ER I have ever been to. The Dr. only saw my husband twice and the second time she had her personal belongings with her, complaining that she was ready to go home bc she was there for  15 hours. She even had the nerve to answer a personal phone call in front of us. Completely unprofessional.\n\nFor something so urgent such as this, I am very surprised at the lack of care we received here.\n\nWe flew all the way from Nashville to have a consultation at what I thought was supposed to be the best cancer treatment center in the country, but I was definitely wrong. After this awful ER visit, we are leaving this place and NEVER returning. Better off going to Vanderbilt.\n\nUpdate: on Wed, Jan 10, discharging my husband took forever, getting prescriptions took hours, when we were finally discharge, there were ZERO wheelchairs accessible on the P level. When the nurse said he would grab one for us or call hospital transportation, he had us waiting for another 30 minutes until I decided to go down to the 1st floor to grab a wheel chair myself. I came back with the wheel chair and the nurse was just sitting on his computer (probably charting which I understand) but patient care involves going above and beyond patient\u2019s expectations and NO ONE at MD Anderson did that for us.\n\nUpdate: Jan 12th, we are already admitted at Vanderbilt in Nashville, preparing for treatment, after only being here an hour. Vanderbilt is already working 10x faster than MD Anderson did. I wouldn\u2019t recommend MD Anderson if it was the last medical center on Earth. It didn\u2019t take hours to see a doctor and it didn\u2019t take hours for pharmacy to personally speak with us regarding treatment. This facility understands urgency.","target_text":"The place isn\u2019t wheelchair friendly at all btw..

{"text":"I'd give this church zero stars if I could.  I have been an active parishioner for 40+ years, with all of my children attending school there.  I just had a mtg with the current pastor, Charles Pardee, in hopes of getting some help with tuition costs for my daughters 8th grade year.  Instead, I was told that I don't tithe enough money to be considered a parishoner.  I've had a lot happen financially over the past year, but still always tithed with my limited disability income.  He was insulting, condescending, cold, & unempathetic.  He even applauded my 'performance' (his exact words).  He has no business being in charge of this parish or even being a priest.  He has zero compassion for anyone that is poor & unable to give him thousands of dollars.   My daughter is 1 of the few black students that attend this school and I guess he's on a mission to eliminate all of the poor black people from 'his' church (the school has a 1% diversity rating).....he made me feel worthless and like I'm a horrible parent.  Even more concerning was his lack of empathy for my daughter not being able to complete her final year with the classmates she's gone to school with since kindergarten, stating that they're not a public school so she doesn't have to be allowed to attend school there.\n\nA priest should help guide you, empathize with you, counsel you, pray with you &\/or comfort you and genuinely care and help you feel Gods love in times of hardships.  Not CHARLES PARDEE, he saves that for the rich people because the poor are just a drain on 'his' church.","target_text":"I've had a lot happen financially over the past year, but still always tithed with my limited disability income.","annotation":"unrelated"}

During the fall you can expect to see family friendly activities like corn mazes, hay rides, sunflower fields as far as the eye can see, and pumpkin patches that are easily accessible. In the winter though, The Berry Farms goes all out. They hire Mr. & Mrs. Clause, decorate the picnic area with lights, there are decorative bows everywhere, sweet treats at the shake stand, and best of all, there is an impressively large Christmas tree that makes for wonderful family photos. If you are not the type of person that is into holidays, fear not because there is still something here for you. The Berry Farms offers Berry picking, sunflower picking, yummy treats, a farmers market, and a chill, laid back setting. That said, keep in mind that there is an entrance fee, but when taking into consideration the variety of activities available, the entrance fee is well worth it.

{"text":"My bi-weekly clean was delayed a week due to a scheduling issue, so they returned to clean 3 weeks later on a Friday afternoon. They didn't clean THE ONE BATHROOM in my home AT ALL, didn't dust any blinds\/windowsills, didn't dust my living room, and failed to vacuum a large portion of my home. I left a vm for Jordan (manager) Saturday morning. I called again Monday and left another message. I'd STILL heard nothing by 4:00pm Tuesday, so I called YET AGAIN. Meanwhile, they'd already charged my credit card full price.\nJordan said they'd come back out a week from the last clean to clean the missed areas, making it one month since my house was last cleaned entirely. I paid full price for my entire home to be cleaned at once, not piecemeal. I requested they clean my entire home again since so much was missed and the time frame so long. He refused that, and refused any refund. When I protested, he hung up on me. They employ the very newly sober living in a halfway house, which they don't disclose to customers. A client has a right to know who they're trusting unsupervised in their home. I love that Two Maids partners with sober living homes and wants to help people rebuild their lives by employing them. However, I do believe the customers should know this up front. Also, perhaps Two Maids needs to improve their screening process upon hiring. Two women cleaned my home that Friday. One of them has cleaned my home before and is amazing. If I could hire her individually, I would. But the other woman was the one responsible for all the issues. I discovered she'd been fired after cleaning my home that day, due to issues having nothing to do with my complaints. She'd been a problem employee with prior customer complaints. Why is someone who's only 5 months sober from hard-core street drugs, with job performance issues and customer complaints, being sent into my home in the first place? Two Maids and a Mop should know better.","target_text":"They didn't clean THE ONE BATHROOM in my home AT ALL, didn't dust any blinds\/windowsills, didn't dust my living room, and failed to vacuum a large portion of my home.","annotation":"unrelated"}

I got scheduled with Dr. Rebekah Costello. On my 1st visit I was 5 minutes late due to an accident on the way to the clinic. I had called the office on my way there and was on hold for almost 10 minutes. By the time they answered I was in the parking lot but they told me I had to reschedule. Unfair. So about a week later Cheryl from the office called me to say I had disability paperwork there and she would start to fill out what she could and ask Dr. Costello to fill it out for me at my appointment. I finally got to meet Dr. Costello and she was rude from the time she walked in the door. Didn\u2019t listen to my medical issues and said she knew nothing about the paperwork I needed filled out for my disability. Dr. Costello even went to the extreme to call a few of my other Dr\u2019s and say that I lied to them. Dr. Costello never filled out any paperwork for me. Actually I hadn\u2019t even seen\/met Dr. Costello when I had my other Dr. fill out my paperwork. She also called another doctor of mine to say that that I was doubling on my RX\u2019s. This is a lie also. They have a list of the medications I\u2019m on and they AREN\u2019T doubled up.  Dr. Costello was the liar because I seen the other Dr. before my appointment with her. I called my other Dr.s office to clear it up and then called the Somers clinic to try to talk to a manager. Had to leave a message. Several times now I\u2019ve left a message with NO call back. I also asked the clinic for my disability paperwork and no one could find it. Imagine that. I\u2019ve been dealing with a chronic cough, headaches\/migraines, low grade fevers and shortness of breath since April. Plus I have an auto immune disease. If I get sick I\u2019m down for the count for awhile. Dr. Costello insisted that I\u2019m not sick. Now I received paperwork in the mail saying she discharged me as a patient. I\u2019ve been in the hospital twice in the last week but again according to her I\u2019m not sick.  So if you want to see a Dr. that doesn\u2019t care about your health.

{"text":"As a store, it would just be a 3-star. Nothing wrong with the food itself, some of it is pretty good, but let's be real, it is NOT worth the inflated price.\n\nHowever, as a courteous neighbor, my rating goes way down. There are several other businesses in this lot, and Lazy Acres has selfishly and recklessly designated 80% of the massive parking lot...just for itself. There is never parking for Rabano or Mama D's, because the jerks at Lazy Acres have bought up all the spaces for themselves. Why? The lot is never more than a quarter full, and the reserved spaces stretch absurdly far and away from the Lazy Acres entrance, going right up to the Mama D's facade, so why did they do this?\n\nThanks to Lazy Acres, there's at minimum 75% of a perfectly good parking lot completely inaccessible to these small businesses' customers. Lazy Acres makes such a pedantic fuss about guilt-free products and ethical food options, how about they practice some of their own ethics and stop being such arrogant neighbors.

I initially called many other places and the customer service was horrible no attempt to even try and earn your business or work with me on trying to make this a surprise birthday gift for my girl friend until I called and spoke with the most amazing spokes person Nadja! From the moment she took my call she was nice, respectful, and most important helpful and went above and beyond to make my wish of this being a surprise for my girl friend a reality and it was. Nadja was able to get the whole staff on board with this being a birthday theme so when we showed up for the appointment that she made happen even after they had no spots available (I said she was amazing) everyone wished Diamond happy birthday and at the end of the first visit Nadja even gave Diamond a birthday gift of a box of chocolates, it was just an amazing day made special by Nadja and the entire staff. Dr. Iskander is very good maybe even perfect in what he does so naturally the surgery went great. They are very thorough at what they do (triple checks are done) and the staff is so polite and genuinely seem to love what they do which is always a good thing. As of the date of this review Diamond's vision has significantly improved from damn near blind (don't kill me babe, LOL) to almost 20\/20 in both eyes. I truly can't say enough about how great this place is so if you are on the fence about getting LASIC\/PRK done, please do yourself a favor and go here, I was skeptical about all the good reviews until I seen with my own eyes why this place is worth more then FIVE STARS.

{"text":"We just bought a Durango about a month ago. Based on all the information about how great the standard model can tow we decided that this was 100% the car to get. We have a large family so the seating was great and being that camping is our life we were buying this car with the end game of getting a bigger camper.\n\nAfter a month we had picked out a camper. We were in the process of putting on a hitch and trying to get the wiring done. We had the hitch installed by U-Haul and then when we asked Dodge about getting the wiring harness attached, they were reluctant to help us. All of a sudden as we are doing research on doing the work ourselves we came across that the 6,200 total tow capacity is not even the correct information on our vehicle. I find out we are at 3,500 tow capacity which is not what we would have agreed to. This is the exact amount we were upgrading from. We did not even have to buy a new car. We were doing this for the sole purpose of camping. The only way we were able to see this info was to access the VIN information on Mopar with the owner\u2019s manual after signing the lease agreement.\n\nNow because we lease the vehicle there is nothing that can be done. The dealership is not answering our calls and we are stuck with this vehicle for three years. Now we cannot camp. It is just very upsetting. I wish the information that people see online was more clear. We would never be in the situation now. It completely breaks my heart. We are not made of money and now we have lost our camping for the next three years.\n\nAt no point when we were buying this car did we hear that there was a towing capacity of 3,500 lbs. We even talked about it during the buy about how we were excited about the 6,200 lb tow rating. Just not right at all. I feel completely blindsided by all of this. In part I blame Dodge as a big company they should think about how to present this information online. It is extremely misleading to consumers like me. Their website says our engine has a maximum tow capacity of 6,200 lbs. What it does not say is you have to have the factory installed tow package included when you purchase the vehicle and you cannot add it yourself as I was lead to believe. Anywhere you look online it reads 6,200 tow capacity for the smaller V6. Even the towing guide that the RV shops have stated that 6,200 figure. There is no version showing 3,500. I have a multitude of screen shots. I would hate for other people to have their camping dreams crushed the same way that they were for my family. We work so hard and this is all we wanted. We don\u2019t go on expensive vacations. We camp. We are not even able to tow our existing camper because the service department won\u2019t touch our wiring.\n\nFollowing up: 3 days of trying to reach our sales representative my husband went down to the dealership. He left 2 days of messages. First off they tried to show my husband a paper that had the tow capacity on it. He had never seen this paper before and it was nothing he had signed. They offered us another vehicle and a buyout offer, but they wanted 2K up front and to raise our lease payments $150 more a month and to add a year. I understand we would need to get out of a lease to make this right and there are costs involved, but is it fair for us to have to pay all that? I think the dealer should be making this right for us, but instead it would be about 8k more than the original deal. We only put a little over 1400 miles on our car and they told us that the value of the car depreciated to 25K from what we started off at which was 38,325 a month prior. It is not like we were throwing the car back at them. We were willing to start another lease with what we thought we were getting. And for the record the car is great. It is the towing issue.\n\nFollowing up: My husband reached out after reading the dealer comment. Since then no response. We would much rather clear this up in a fair manner, but it appears this was just to make the dealership appear like they want to help on a review when in fact nothing is being done. Will be getting a lawyer.","target_text":"I feel completely blindsided by all of this.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"BOILING SEAFOOD RESTAURANT,  MARYSVILLE: My family and  I would bypass this restaurant for quite a while, because we had previously had unpleasant experiences with the previous Chinese restaurant. Tonight, looking for something different, we looked at Google reviews and most  said the new place was much better. So, we decided to try it again. Tonight, we opted for Chinese instead of sea food. I had the fried pork steak, fried rice, and pot stickers.  My husband had curry chicken and I shared up the pork and pot stickers.   As far as it goes most places don't put enough curry in the dish. He doesn't even think those kinds taste like curry, but tonight he found out that this place seasons the curry more authentically, so that he, could, at least, taste the appropriate amount of seasoning.  My pork was awesome! The meat was tender and tasty,  it didn't need any salt or seasonings; the house fried rice, did, however, need seasoning-- definitely needed salt--so I added a little soy sauce.  The pot stickers were much better than most places that serve pot stickers in the Marysville area. They were crispier and tastier; but the dipping sauce  was extremely salty, almost too salty to taste and use--I simply used  less.  I included pictures from most areas of the restaurant, which as you can see has fairly nice d\u00e9cor. As I was coming in to pick up my food, I was snapping a few quiet pictures, when the  man at the counter stopped me from taking photos of that area. As you can see from the other photos, there is an ample free parking area, and it is easily accessible from the street. It''s also easily seen from the street. There is handicapped parking which has easy access for handicapped people to enter.\nUPDATE 05-31-18: I went for myself only tonight, a quick meal of broccoli beef and pot stickers. Quick review: AWESOME. The broccoli was cooked through, the beef, tender, the sauce, delicious and savory, AND the meal wasn't 90% broccoli(and I love broccoli)--there was plenty of meat. This is the best broccoli beef around, better than ANY in town, hands down. I give it 5 stars.

{"text":"I am a customer with a disability (both visual and physical) in other words I am both newly blind and I have a bad back. I have been coming to this shopping mall for about three years now often on you see I have enjoyed the many selections of the stores I like the location that it's and I also enjoy a good portion of the staff that is willing to help when seeing me struggle with certain directions for an example when trying to find a store. I have one tiny suggestion what store you need to put in your shopping mall you know that you have the room for it you need an Apple Store. It would be terrific to have a store like this you do have cell phone stores who sell iPhones you know and why not have an Apple store you could actually have quite a big one which would in essence trump the one in Glendale at the Americana. This is only a suggestion; And I'm hoping this is taken seriously it would be nice. Now my true reason why am now leaving comment and statement as I said I am a person with a double disability or in this case on many stages multiple disabilities and I utilize much like many who go to this mall with disabilities they utilize A paratransit service I was made aware where the new stand for access paratransit will be placed it is incredibly inconvenient in the place by which the stand is posted I say this because it is next to a multi tiered parking lot right next to Macy's that is a very dangerous place when it gets dark especially for your disabled your elderly and even for just general people taking even the local dialer ride system. Could there not have been a better place to have put your stand for your customers waiting for para transit or transportation to assist them that is just poor taste and if anything it sends a message that your mom does not like or just not want the disabled shopping at this mall which is actually quite saddening to me and many and I know with disabilities because it is a beautiful mall there is so much this mall offers versus dare I say Glendale Galleria for an example yes it's a nice small to but I would choose Arcadia over Glendale in a heartbeat yes Arcadia is much farther for me but I still like Arcadia. There are more stores there are more selections there are nice places to actually sit and relax you just need a Starbucks in your mall and it would be perfect that and an Apple Store but who cares you have a movie theater in your mall you have an excellent staff at that movie theater by the way they also need to upgrade and as well have narrative equipment such as headphone checks for films for the blind that must be narrated because many blind people like to watch movies too we listen to them instead of watching them picture by picture as people do with site I've had to learn this from day one when losing my eyesight it's only been eight knack years for me I am now 40 of course but I'm learning more and more these are just some things that your mom could offer to its patrons but you do have many great stories that a lot of shopping malls don't provide and this is what makes your mall unique it would be nice if there was a more appropriate \"\"Stand\"\" for it's disabled patrons to therefore be picked up in where it was not a safety hazard in other words, not next to a multi tiered parking lot I'm sure there are plenty of spaces that your proprietary management and mall management could find and discuss that would be more appropriate. Other than that, I like this mall and I would hate not to go to it anymore because I would be in feared for my safety of not being mugged or God for bid worse because when it gets dark that's usually when most crime happens especially in multitier parking lots nearby.\nI thank you for your consideration and understanding and I do expect my statements to be taken seriously.

There are a bunch of kids running the place and they have NO idea of the definition of \"customer service.\"  The first time I went, there was nobody at the front of the line to take my order, so I moved down to the next person who was helping someone else at the time. When he finished, he informed me I would have to go back to the beginning.  Two other people were in line behind me now and nobody said (since I was already in line), we'll take your order now.  I had to go to the BACK of the line even though I had been standing there 10 minutes!  The two cowardly men standing behind me said nothing.  And to top it off, I was with a disabled teen!

I gave it to the front attendant and went to visit my mom. I had been visiting over 20 minutes and her food had not been brought to her yet.  I went back to the front and asked them why it hadn't been taken back to her. A worker told me she would look for it. I waited for a good 5 minutes for the worker to come to the door. I went back to the visit and a few minutes later a young man came onto the hall and didn't even know who the food was for. Once that had been taken care of my mom's room mate had to use the bathroom, and asked my elderly mom to help her, because no one would help her. My mom informed me that she always has to help her, because no one will help. My mom has had a hip replacement and a broken wrist and is almost deaf and legally blind.

He also was careful in opening each of the blinds to get to the windows knowing that sometimes blinds don\u2019t work very well, especially on old windows.  In addition, my wife was carrolling our three year old as it was bath and bed time and thus did not have time to listen to the sales pitch, which Christian was perfectly fine with (this was appreciated).  Overall, Christian was a very nice and pleasant guy.\n\nBeyond that, I did not care much of anything for the sales pitch that was thrown at me at the end of a 2 hour presentation.  Let me say this first though.  The product sounds solid.  They seem to care and stand behind their windows and their workmanship, including covering any needed use of the warranty, which transfers to two subsequent owners (I suppose this is good, but don\u2019t know if this truly adds to the price of the home).\n\nBut as for the actual sales pitch, it was too timeshare like for me.  And I should know having been through several timeshare presentations in the past.  They start with the \u201cgood for 1 year\u201d estimate which is outrageously high.  Over $2k a window?  They try to justify it by taking you through some supposed invoices from other window installers showing their prices which I think is an effort to numb you toward dropping their outrageous initial price on you.  Plus they say their prices include parts and labor costs of any warranty work that you may never need if the product is as good as they say it is.\n\nThen there is the \u201cfirst visit discount\u201d.  The discount is only good up to the point he leaves your home.  Quite the high pressure sales tactic.  The price with the first visit discount was still way beyond what I was expecting.  I politely declined jumping at the discounted price after I verified that I would \u201close\u201d the discount once he left the home (I sure didn\u2019t feel like I was actually losing anything).\n\nChristian then said, well, he wanted to make sure we explored all the available options and then presented another possibility.  As a part of gathering information from homes on how much money folks saved by installing their windows (I think he called this an energy audit where they would have exact comparison information of your energy bills before and after the window replacement), if I agreed to be a part of this program after installing their windows, I would receive an even better discount than the first visit discount (price per window came just under $2k at that point).  This was the point that I kept thinking this reminded me of a timeshare sales pitch (just keep throwing a lower number until it seemed \u201ctoo good to pass up\u201d).\n\nChristian was never initially clear on how long this new discounted price would last, but it became clear after he took the first visit and the energy audit discount pricing and stuffed it in his folder and left me with only the 1 year price.\n\nOverall, they do a really good job in showing the product is really well made and that they stand behind it.  But the outrageous price and adolescent sales pitch turned me off from considering this company at all in the future.  My hope is that this review will be read with an open mind from the owners\/managers of the company and for it to be an opportunity to perhaps update their sales practices.  Just give your best and honest price and then be done with it.  I would have appreciated that from the beginning.","target_text":"He also was careful in opening each of the blinds to get to the windows knowing that sometimes blinds don\u2019t work very well, especially on old windows.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Be VERY VERY cautious when leasing from these people. The WORST property management we've ever had to deal with. And a bunch of crooks. If you like people taking your money, this is the place for you.\nWe were bounced around between 3 agents- each time one quit, we were handed over to someone new.\nThe home we rented was previously occupied by pets (we were told no animals were in the home). \"Professionally cleaned carpets\" still had dog piss smell, and I vacuumed 4 canisters of dog hair. (Cindy, one of the agents assured us that there's way, since the carpets were cleaned) I think not.\nThey tell you your rents will be prorated- but when your last month rolls around they charge you the full months rent... And no lease can end after the 25th of the month. Bunch of BS if you ask me... So depending what your rent rate is, they are pocketing anywhere from $200-$400.\nThey get out of paying for utilities by making current tenants keep it in their name 3 days after lease, and new tenants putting it in their name the same day prior tenants cancel utilities.\nThey use only one carpet company, who charges the most (but know they are getting a discounted rate to keep more of our security deposit.)\nWe had electrical issues when we moved in, that were never tended to. We were left with pre-existing holes and nails in the walls from previous tenants, and were told it would be on our own dime to fill them, APM would not be doing it.\nWe were also told that paint for the walls was in the utility closet and we could do paint touchups (just no changing pre-exisitng paint colors). Okay, so we touched up handprints and marks made by movers.\nWe moved out and had our inspection. To then be told we would be paying for the walls to be repainted because the paint didn't match (now, keep in mind this is the same paint located in utility closest for the whole house).\nOh! And then, we purchased blinds to be put up in the master, because the windows didn't have any. We chose to leave them on the windows when moving out (help out the suckers who moved in after us).

{"text":"Brewster\u2019s Windmill, also known as, Old Higgin\u2019s Farm Windmill, was originally located at Route 6A and Ellis Landing Road, in Brewster. The windmill was moved 100 yards toward Cape Cod Bay and away from the road because the sound of the sails scared horses as they passed. About 1890, it was moved to Ellis Landing Road onto the Roland Crosly Nickerson Estate. Here it functioned as a clubhouse at the golf course. Mrs. Samuel Nickerson gave the mill to the Brewster\u2019s Historical Society. In December 1974, the windmill was transported down Route 6A on a flatbed trailer to its present site, 6 miles from its original location.\n\nBrewster\u2019s Windmill is now found on 1.35 acres, donated to the Brewster Historical Society by Mr. And Mrs. Lewis McGowan, owners of the adjacent Drummer Boy Museum on Route 6A. The Windmill, built in 1795, was restored in July, 1976, with a matching grant from the Massachusetts Bicentennial Commission.\n\nBrewster\u2019s Windmill has an advantageous location for windmill enthusiasts because it sits in an open field and is visible from the road. The Historical Society certainly met the requests of Mrs. Nickerson when she gave them the windmill. She asked that the windmill be restored, preserved and open to the public. It has been authentically restored, meticulously preserved, well maintained and easily accessible to the public. The octagonal, 20-foot diameter base supports a revolving cap that was constructed with curved timbers similar to a hull of a ship. Pulling the tail pole rotates the revolving cap. The tail pole is attached to a wagon wheel on the ground. It is pulled by a horse, ox or human so that the masts face into the wind. The entire mill stands 30 feet tall.\n\nThe interior of Brewster\u2019s Windmill is just as fascinating as the impressive exterior. This windmill\u2019s equipment has also been preserved. The interior consists of three floors. The top level houses the brake wheel and allows access to the curved timbers in the cap so that they can be greased periodically to allow the rotation movement of the cap. The middle floor houses the original five-foot diameter millstones. The ground floor has a bin that holds the ground meal. Here is also found the frame supports for the three tons of millstones.\n\nA unique character of this mill is the presence of a corn cob cracker on the first floor which is used to make animal feed and fertilizer. Other interesting attributes that are intrinsically characteristic of the Brewster Windmill are the rare ship carvings on the feed bin. These carvings, called scrimshaw, were often found on ships created by sailors. There are many characteristics of the Brewster Windmill that indicate that a ship builder constructed it. The windshaft is designed like one that holds a mast. The curved timbers in the cap and the pegged floor are also indications that the builder of this mill was a seaman.\n\nA visit to the Brewster Windmill will be most rewarding. Brewster\u2019s Windmill, also known as, Old Higgin\u2019s Farm Windmill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 1975.","target_text":"It has been authentically restored, meticulously preserved, well maintained and easily accessible to the public.","annotation":"unrelated"}

I have stayed at many Aloft hotels through the years and it is my favorite of the brand.  First off this hotel is not cheap normally.  If you can get a room at any of them worldwide under $150 you're doing well.  The room was facing the river on the 2nd floor and it was very clean.  Free bottled water and refrigerator in the room is a great amenity.  We went to the pool and it was clean and faced the river.  Bartenders were especially friendly and fun!

{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. I had my 08 sti in because I was having misfire issues. They had it for about a week and a half and during that time they called me and told me they fixed the issue 4 different times. Within 5 minutes of picking it up I had the exact same misfire issues every time. I had to have it towed back to the service department for theme to work on it AGAIN. About $1500 later in parts and labor that the car didn't need at all, the problem was still there even though they said they had fixed it. Eventually I did my own 15 minutes of research and found it was my crankshaft sensor that was just dirty. For $30 I bought a new one, installed it in less than 5 minutes and all of my problems were gone. If you ever have problems with your subaru, never bring it here unless you want to get scammed and still have the same existing problem. After I talked to them about it they just simply said they couldn't figure It out even though that's their job. It was the cheapest, most easily accessible sensor on the entire car and they didn't think to check that when that was the main code that would be thrown. I'll be back in for some money back since they charged me $1500 to fix a problem they didn't even come close to fixing.

The lady rudely said I don't have any openings for today and it will be more than 2 weeks before I can get you scheduled. She clearly saw me aid the lady before me into the service center and allow her to go ahead of me. Her attitude was beyond rude to me. I honestly have to question why....

{"text":"Customer service is horrible. I was returning items and the guy made a mistake and one item was not included. I returned immediately to have it corrected. There were two people working and only one customer during a return who was in line when I finished the first time. I waited until the guy who helped me was done with the other customer, declining help from the girl who was on the phone when I initially got back in line. I clearly was waiting for him because I didn't know where he had placed my items amongst the other returns. The girl was will to help but she didn't know which items. The guy completely ignored me and was ready to walk away. I stopped him to tell him about the mistake that was made and ask that he just point out my items to the girl so she can further assist me. His reply was when he is done with the other customer. From the time I walked in the second time to finish I waited 20 minutes. Mind you there were no other customers behind me at first then a line started forming some people walked away. The desk is for returns but the customers ahead of me were not doing returns they required more time. I requested that they call for back up and the response was when they were done with the other customers. That is not acceptable at any point to have any one wait that long, especially when they made the mistake. I had to insist that the girl help me while the customer she was helping  was on the phone with customer service. She was hesitant which makes no sense because the customer was also on the phone with customer service. That makes no sense. I complained to someone but it may have fallen on deaf ears. This location is not busy at all compared to other stores. I go to several Lowes in different locations at least once a day for supplies, this is the reason why I started going to this location, because they are not busy.

{"text":"When The Knitting Factory burned down my concert got relocated to The Egyptian Theater. It was a lovely facility. It was beautiful and fun to look around and the seats were comfortable for at least 30 minutes before I started to shift around. The downsides were thus: the lights blinded the front 6 rows (at least) for the duration of all 3 musical acts - my concert buddy had a brutal headache by the time the main act started. (My headache set in later.) The \"reserved seats\" were totally useless when 200 nosebleed section tickets rushed to the front of the concert hall to stand, and non-reserved ticket holders grabbed more than a couple of the reserved seats which led to conflict for those of us who paid quite a bit more for our spots. Many of us who purchased adjacent seats were split up. Also, those of us who would have preferred to sit, including a much older crowd that paid for good seated seating, had to stand for the 2 hour performance because the group that rushed down to the front were permitted to stand there for the entire concert. (Thankfully the standing group were well behaved - it could have been much worse.) Getting in to the concert lacked some finesse, but that was mostly the fault of a much older facility and the 4 columns of hand-held metal-detectors at the door that slowed things down. There were also a lot of sound issues throughout the concert, but I have no way of knowing who was responsible for that. I hope I have the chance to come back and see an event here that was meant to be here - I suspect it would be a much more streamlined experience.","target_text":"The downsides were thus: the lights blinded the front 6 rows (at least) for the duration of all 3 musical acts - my concert buddy had a brutal headache by the time the main act started.","annotation":"unrelated"}

Apparently, there was a problem with one of my cards. I then said it was fine if I just used one, and paid for the rest of it myself since the other card was \u201cnot working\u201d.

Yet, he continued to mock me as I was on the phone with the company. Not only that, but shortly afterwards, he had the nerve to say, \u201cUh yeah we can\u2019t figure out why the card is bad. We\u2019ll just have to use one card and you\u2019ll pay for the rest.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, I was furious, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to do in the first place. Yet you ignored me,\u201d to which he responded,  \u201cThat\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I got my prescription (which also was the wrong one, btw) and got the hell out of there. I\u2019ve since switched pharmacies and have had absolutely no issues with the other card or prescription.

{"text":"So I recently applied to work here and my initial application was for a part time position. I made sure it was for a part time position. It wasn\u2019t long after my application was sent that I get a call from the hiring manager herself. She says that there is no part time positions that there are only full time position. You have to work 8 hours and the only thing you get is a half an hour break. Her words not mine. Umm, pretty sure in NH that\u2019s illegal. You really need to read up on the NH employment laws. Secondly, you take pride and joy in claiming you hire people with disabilities. No you really don\u2019t. On the phone I told her that I have back problems which has been diagnosed as scoliosis and arthritis in the spine so I can not stand for more than 5 hours. She says everyone stands here and we don\u2019t accommodate for anyone. So, you really don\u2019t hire anyone with a defined disability then? I was thinking about my options because I really needed a job and she told me this was a two way conversation and that she needed an immediate answer. Overall she was completely rude and this is the face of the company. Seriously? This was a phone call just to set up the interview. They only pay you $8.50 an hour. Yeah, no way would I take being talked to like that for chump change.  Never in my life have I had a job interview that flopped this badly. Someone needs to really look at the people they hire and make some adjustments.","target_text":"Secondly, you take pride and joy in claiming you hire people with disabilities.

{"text":"This is my favorite miniature golf venue of all time! My husband and I enjoy playing both courses here. It's reasonably priced, and so much fun! Difficulty is more advanced for both courses, but especially the Fairways course--which is truly a miniaturized golf course. The Garden (\"fun\") course will test your luck and your ability to assess angles, while the Fairways course will test your strategy and general putting skills. The Fantasia theming is classic and very entertaining (even if you've never seen the film). The music is the cherry on top of it all! I mean, come on, Rhapsody in Blue... \ud83d\udc99\n\nParking is easily accessible. Courses play well both in daylight and at night--you may even catch the fireworks at Epcot and Hollywood studios in the sky while you play! Cast members are very friendly and knowledgeable.

{"text":"Although you can take your cat to any clinic, I like and trust Cat Care Professionals.\n\nDr. Cornwell (and staff) specializes in feline veterinary medicine only. I feel more confident because I know this means she is staying ahead of innovative treatment options, cost-saving measures, and specialties like geriatric cats. I don't know how vets who treat a wide range of animals can possibly learn it all.\n\nThe other thing I really like about Dr. Cornwell is her compassion. I've been to many vets who are great with my cat, but awkward in communicating with me. Being a pet owner can be an emotional ride, and this doesn't seem to faze Dr. Cornwell at all. Many times, I've appreciated her soothing voice and her ability to make complex medical information accessible.\n\nDr. Cornwell's dedication to her patients and their owners is remarkable. It's clear that she loves her work and gets great satisfaction from doing it well. If you're the kind of \"cat mom\/dad\" who values quality care in a caring environment, visit their clinic.

{"text":"Wellllllll. The move in process went fine for me. They were upfront with prices and final move in amounts. Getting my keys was fast and easy. However, upon move in, I realized there were roaches EVERYWHERE. To make it worse, they were in the kitchen. After telling management, I was told they would be in to spray. That happened but left me not able to unpack the first week I moved in. Major inconvenience. As my first week went by I noticed some other issues within the apartment. I had no hot water, my front door wouldn\u2019t close properly, my bathroom sink and tub were clogged, apartment itself wasn\u2019t properly cleaned, back porch blinds are put on backwards and some other minor issues. My main concern was the front door, clogged sinks, and of course the roaches. They sprayed an additional time a week after the first and I have seen little to none cockroaches since. They fixed my tub drain but didn\u2019t fix my bathroom sink. And no other fixes were made. I went in to the office and pretty much told them I was ready to look elsewhere and they were very much accommodating and apologetic stating they had another apartment ready for me to move in to. I walked it and it was night and day to the one they put me in. I was shocked that the apartments were capable of looking that good. Now, I was very disappointed (still am) because I had just moved everything myself during my lunch hours and they expect everything to be ok by offering another unit. I was considering it but I didn\u2019t have the help nor the money to hire movers to help me move AGAIN. I asked them if there would be any compensation for the inconvenience and I was told \u201cno because we have waived the pest control fee and transfer fee which would have been $300, we are also adding an additional cleaning service free at charge\u201d LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I HAD COCKROACHES AND A DIRTY APARTMENT TO BEGIN WITH AND I JUST WOKE UP ONE DAY WANTING TO TRANSFER. THEY WERE DOING ME NO FAVOR...as frustrated as I was, I just said \u201cthank you\u201d and hung up. Fast forward a week and half of living here, I still received no cleaning service, there are no cable outlets so the apartments are not cable ready, my bathroom sink is clogged, but I have not seen as many roaches and things seem to be getting a little better.\n\nAlso- I forgot the assistant managers name and as much as she was a help in getting things done faster she was very unprofessional by telling misty what she did wrong right in front of me. Not the way the handle business.\n\nIn the end, they did work hard to get the roaches out and help me in ways they could have. I think they could\u2019ve been more efficient and I\u2019m very disappointed with this whole situation but I am here and hopefully this will be a learning lesson for everyone!

{"text":"The Alum Cave Trailhead is 8.7 miles south past Sugarlands Visitor Center along Newfound Gap Road. There are several parking areas on the left, but on the day that I went it was extremely crowded (arrived around 11am) and all parking spaces were full necessitating parking on the side of the road.\n\nThe first section of the trail (to Arch Rock) is at a fairly gentle grade and follows the Alum Cave Creek.\n\n1.3 miles from the trailhead appears Arch Rock. The trail continues under the arch and has several steps cut into the stone that you climb up before exiting through the top.\n\nPast Arch Rock, the trail continues to Alum Cave. The view includes Anakeesta Ridge predominantly on your left.\n\nAt roughly 2 miles from the trailhead you'll arrive at Inspiration Point, that offers a view of Little Duck Hawk Ridge to the west, and Myrtle Point towards the Northeast.\n\nAt 2.2 miles, you reach Alum Cave (full disclosure, it isn't a cave). Alum Cave is actually a concave bluff, approximately 80 feet in height and roughly 500 feet long. Alum Cave has a history being mined first for epsom salt by The Epsom Salts Manufacturing Company (1838) and then for saltpeter which is used to manufacture gunpowder, by the Confederate Army during the Civil War.\n\nPast Alum Cave, the trail continues, hugging the cliff face. Over these next two miles you'll find several narrow rock ledges, including some with cable handrails due to the water seeping out of the rock walls.\n\nBeyond this point the trail levels out and you pass through a dense spruce-fir forest. The Alum Cave Trail ends 5 miles from the trailhead and dead-ends into Rainbow Falls Trail. Take a right here to continue to the summit of Mt. LeConte.\n\nA short distance on you'll arrive at the outskirts of the LeConte Lodge area, The actual summit of Mt. LeCounte is another half-mile however. You can also take a right to Cliff Top for panoramic views.\n\nTo reach the summit, take the Trillium Gap Trail which branches off to the left at approximately 5.2 miles. The summit, better known as High Top, is at the 5.5 mile mark... designated by a large cairn off to the right at 6,593 feet. This makes Mt. LeConte the tallest mountain in the Eastern United States, rising 5301 feet from its base near Gatlinburg.","target_text":"Over these next two miles you'll find several narrow rock ledges, including some with cable handrails due to the water seeping out of the rock walls..","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I would give Michael more stars if I could.\n\nMichael is obviously passionate and experienced at what he does. I am a HIIT workout enthusiast and CrossFit athlete, and I had never worked with any physical therapist before, but after months of lower back soreness, hip pain, and neck stiffness, I decided it was time to do something about the frustrating pain I was experiencing. No amount of foam rolling or stretching seemed to help.\n\nI thought I needed some combination of a chiropractic adjustment and deep-tissue massage, but was in uncharted territory in regards to what exactly I needed. Luckily, I stumbled upon Fortitude via a blind Google search, and read about Michael. It seemed like people were experiencing similar symptoms as me, so I shot him a text.\n\nAfter asking several clarifying, curious questions, Michael confirmed that he could help with the symptoms I was experiencing.\n\nWe set an appointment up for the next day, and I showed him stretches that irritate my lower back and hips. After listening intently, I could see him stare up at the ceiling working through the different muscle groups in his mind while he verbally taught me about how muscles relate to pains and the root cause of pain could be some other unexpected muscle (for example, when I told him about my back, he immediately started searching for tenderness and knots in my hips).\n\nThe next hour was the most educational and helpful time I could have spent. I wish I had called Michael months ago. Seriously. This guy cares DEEPLY about what he does and how he can serve people.\n\nWe uncovered a half-dozen knots in my hips and shoulders, and I learned that my shoulders were crooked, my left leg was shorter than my right, my hips were turned, and my lower back was simply a symptom of all of\nthis misalignment.\n\nMichael would push his elbow into the sore areas and constantly ask for a pain scale from 1-10. As he got closer and closer to the root of the muscle tightness, the pain simply released. Then he would take his percussive machine and massage the areas, loosening the muscles up even more. We repeated this until I felt no pain and had a full range of motion on the stretches that initially gave me trouble.\n\nMichael asked about my time in Nashville, family, and shared a bit of his story, too. I genuinely enjoyed this session.\n\nI walk out of his session feeling 100%. Seriously, instant relief.\n\nLater that day I went into our local gym and pushed myself through a workout that included kettlebell swings, squats, and many other movements that had given me trouble, previously. I felt like a new man.\n\nMichael not only relieved my pain, but educated me on how to prevent misalignment in the future, and even told me I should be okay to just do this one session with him. After this session, I trust him and will absolutely refer friends and family to him.\n\nI cannot recommend Michael highly enough.

{"text":"I am giving this place three stars - one for the view of the sunset at the pool, one for the convenience to the manta rays (1\/2 star) and hotel upkeep and options (1\/2 star), and the last for the onsite market shop.\n\nThe first star - the pool.  The pool is amazing at this place.  They even have an adult only side where kids aren't allowed.  The kids pool, however, has the absolute best view of the sunset.  We would grab a drink at Holua, sit in the hot tub to relax after a long day and watch the most beautiful Hawaiian sunsets.  If your kids LOVE hotel pools, this is one of the ultimate hotel pools.\n\nThe second star - the manta ray feedings (1\/2 star) and the hotel upkeep and offerings (1\/2 star).  My husband went to Hawaii when he was little and very vividly remembers the manta rays, so we wanted to give these same memories to our kids.  It's pretty cool.  You don't need to be a hotel resident to watch the manta rays though, just head on in to the lower lower deck of Rays on the Bay.  This is NOT something that I would consider when booking this hotel.  It's totally not something unique to Sheraton, just convenient.  The exterior of the hotel is very well kept.  It is in an absolutely gorgeous location, offers movies near the pool, life size chess\/checkers available to play, etc.  The hotel rooms are also quite large with lots of space.  It really is a neat hotel and great for families.\n\nThe third star - the market shop onsite.  They also have a small little marketplace shop on site where you can buy your booze or water bottles at a reasonable price and even find some cute last minute souvenirs.  This was a cool feature of the hotel and was similar to an ABC store with more of a convenience store vibe.  I wish more places had this because it made our life so much easier.\n\nNow let me tell you why I did not enjoy this hotel...\n\nThe bathroom toilet and sink are made for people under 4ft tall.  Literally.  I did NOT have a handicap accessible room, and had to bend over to brush my teeth... I am 5'6\".  My poor 6'4\" husband really had a hard time reaching the sink counter.  The toilet?  Oh my god... absolutely the WORST.  You don't notice it as much when you sit down, but when you try to wipe or get up - you realize you're on a toilet for very little people.  We did not receive more shampoo\/conditioner\/soap after using it all the first night.  Probably an oversight, but thankful we brought extra shampoo and soap.  The shower head had very little water pressure.  The bathroom was just a disappointment.  I was really unhappy after getting into our room after a long day and having to deal with the bathroom on the first night.  When we went down to the pool, we joked about the horrible bathrooms and short toilet\/sink with other guests - so this was not isolated to just my room.  Not to mention, the bathrooms are very dated... probably the same bathroom my husband used 30 years ago as a child.  Also, our room fridge did not work.  I have read this on other Yelp reviews.  Do not bring your food back, you will have no way to store it safely.\n\nThe other disappointment about this place - the PAPER THIN WALLS.  I could literally hear an entire conversation my neighbors were having.  No privacy whatsoever.  For being such a family-friendly resort, this sucks.  We had to get on to our kids nonstop to be quiet because we knew how much we could hear of our adult neighbor's conversations... I can only imagine what they heard from our side.  If you stay here, ask if you have neighbors so you'll know if you have to whisper or not.\n\nWe think the hotel is lovely... great location, convenient to the manta rays, great for families, love the on site shop... but the bathroom and paper thin wall situation has to be fixed.  Will we be back to this hotel? No.  We will book elsewhere.","target_text":"I did NOT have a handicap accessible room, and had to bend over to brush my teeth.","annotation":"negative"}

{"text":"Primarily, I go there for my eyebrows. Cece has always taken her time to ensure that my eyebrows are always on point.  Generally, I have thick eye brows, so when eyebrow techs mess up, I notice immediately!  However, Cece has done such a great job that I have continued to have her do my eye brows for years.  Initially, I would go to Vy, however, she started to make my left eyebrow higher than my right eyebrow, but once I started going to Cece, my eyebrows have been P-E-R-F-E-C-T! For the most part though, everyone there is really good with eyebrows, I simply prefer to go to Cece because she is able to consistently give me the shape I want.  I believe she takes pride in my eyebrows, as all eyebrow techs should with their customers.\n\nPedicure was great! Nothing much to say there.

{"text":"Terrible experience with this store. Omar lied to us!! I was already upset with having to visit this store because Verizon disabled my SIM card and you can't get a free replacement at authorized retailers. On top of this I have a tablet that stopped working on Wi-Fi with less than 3 hours of use (it sat in a drawer for 6 months still in package) The phone we bought along with the tablet also has issues. The MotoZ at around 8 months old started shutting off when reaching 30% battery. This problem only got worse and the phone turns off at 70-80% now.\n\nI was ready to take my business elsewhere after being a Verizon customer for close to 20 years when Omar gave me and my wife a shred of hope saying the best they could do to retain us as customers was to overnight us 2 new devices along with return shipping for the faulty devices free of charge because we paid for insurance.\n\nEvery part of his statement was false. The warranty\/insurance program does not replace with a new device, but a refurbished device. They also do not send tablets. The old tablet must be returned 1st. Upon returning home I checked to make sure both shipments were on the way as we were only emailed the receipt for the phone only to find a 5 dollar charge! So now I sit on hold with corporate after telling Omar I had already wasted 2 hours at the authorized dealer troubleshooting, had to make an out of the way trip to get \"real Verizon support\" , and was sick of wasting time and ready to go to T-Mobile where I can get out from under these 2 terrible devices without worrying about the remaining balances. Lying to us definitely doesn't help the situation even if it got us out of the store.\n\nThere is simply no reason for me to continue doing business with Verizon and I advise anyone going to this store to be wary of false promises and overall deceit. Honesty would have saved a customer here. Now, I get to waste more of my and Verizon's valuable time and will more than likely take my business elsewhere as I have zero confidence Verizon will do the right thing and fight to retain a loyal customer.","target_text":"I was already upset with having to visit this store because Verizon disabled my SIM card and you can't get a free replacement at authorized retailers.","annotation":"unrelated"}

The unit was spotless, the towels and linens luxurious. The water pressure in the shower was amazing! The location was great, 1 mile from River Street. Being from the country the traffic outside the front bedroom was different. Not used to so much traffic noise, but once asleep I never heard it. The lights from Forsythe Park shown into the bedroom thru the blinds, but again, once asleep I didn't notice. Met the actual owner of the units and he was a wealth of knowledge of all things Savannah. Loved sitting on the front stoop and people watching.

You choose the floor you want while in the elevator lobby and it assigns you and elevator, A, B, C or D.

You shut the door behind you, check it from the hall and it reopened without a key. Security reset it and the first time we used our keys it was broke again.

In my mind i was wondering if he was going to start the other couples food after ours was ready, little did i know that they had lumped in 5 orders and a 6th obviously take away order in the little food being prepared on the grill, to cut the  story short, we each were served aboht 10 tea spoons of fried rice a few flakes of vegetable and at this point i was hopping mad i had ordered shrimps, scallops and lobsters with satueed mushroom on the  side,i watched in agony as this chef scooped the entire mushroom and shrimps which could barely make 2 servings and split it up between the couple and a stero foam plate into which a portion of everything made on that table was dumped-i couldn't hold my anger anymore and i demanded for the shrimps i orhidered but the  chef insisted that i did not order shripms, the waiter who took our orders had to be called in and it was confirmed that i did indeed order shrimps at which point  she offered to have them quickly boil some shrimps-boil-shrimps??? !!! Of course i said no! I couldnt wait to get out there.\nThe food itself was bland and totally uninteresting .we parted with 70dollars all the while weeping inwardly and they had the efontry  to ask for a tip! I simply cancelled it and wrote in capital letters NO TIP!

One thing i have always disliked about this location, mainly, is how pushy the salesmen are. You give them perameters of what you are looking for and they immediately come up with something that is less than you wanted for more money than you wanted to spend. Its not until you are walking away that they are willing to offer you products at the prices you want to pay. It makes you experience feel crooked and unwelcoming. It literally becomes a matter of how much money can they squeeze from you every time. But that being said, every once in a while if you watch the circular you can find a great deal on something.

{"text":"We were so disappointed & frustrated with our most recent purchase\/delivery.\n\nI purchased a King mattress\/box spring\/frame. I specifically asked our Sales Associate if they would take the old mattress\/box spring to which she replied, \"Yes, free of charge!\". On the day of delivery at 9:00am two men showed up & moved my old mattress & box spring upright, blocking my bathroom. I could not be of much help to them because I had knee surgery two days prior.\n\nAs they assembled the frame they informed me it was the incorrect size & that I needed to call Customer Service. I told them they needed to take the old mattress\/box spring; they told me no and left. I called Customer Service & was told that they would have to schedule a \"Rescue Delivery\" to assemble the frame. She told me it was in fact the correct frame but the \"3rd party delivery men\" did not know how to put it together. She then told me they would not take the old mattress because there was an ink stain on it & it was considered bio-hazard. This disclaimer was NEVER disclosed to us. I insisted the delivery men come back; she refused & told me that I would have to wait until 8pm (11 hours later).\n\nI called again & told a new person my dilemma. She told me that I needed to wait until 8pm for the Rescue Delivery & then a 2nd driver would come \"take pictures of the old mattress.\". I am not sure why pictures needed to be taken.\n\nI was left at 10am with my old mattress blocking my bathroom\/closet\/dresser, a half assembled frame strewn across by bedroom floor & the new mattress\/box spring still wrapped in plastic.\n\nNot having any luck over the phone I called a taxi & was dropped off at the Monrovia Store. I crutched my way to Customer Service & requested a manager. After much arguing the manager Alexus, she arranged 1 delivery; she told me he would assemble the frame & she was POSITIVE he would take the old mattress\/box spring.\n\nI waited around all day & finally the delivery man arrived. He assembled the frame & then tried to leave, refusing to take the old mattress. Furious I called Customer Service and they told me that because Michael (delivery man) was 3rd party they could not make him take the mattress. Just when he was leaving I noticed he ripped a hole in the BRAND NEW mattress. I had to schedule a whole new delivery 2 days later.\n\nThis entire situation is an embarrassment to Living Spaces. I find it very dangerous that the delivery men left my bathroom blocked. My medical supplies & medications were in the bathroom & I was unable to shower or use the restroom until they came back at 4:00pm. Luckily I am young & was able to do without until they returned but if I were elderly &\/or handicapped this could have been detrimental.","target_text":"Luckily I am young & was able to do without until they returned but if I were elderly &\/or handicapped this could have been detrimental.","annotation":"negative"}

It was a joke, quite frankly (he is vegetarian so the options were limited), my fish and chips were overdone and dry. By far the worse fish and chips I have ever tasted. The batter is not light and fluffy-but is more of a chicken fingers batter. My sangria tasted like it was boxed red wine with some ice thrown in-there was no fruity taste.

{"text":"Okay where should I begin I have a laundry list of things wrong with this place for starters let's start with I was told that the rooms are non-smoking all the rooms are non-smoking when I got to my room the room stunk like cigarette smoke but no other room was available and they put me next to the elevator and it was extremely noisy people coming and going constantly and people smoking right outside my door so that kind of sucked. Second thing wrong with this place is my auntie came to visit me and stayed with me on the second floor I had requested a handicap room because she is handicapped and I was told I could have one on the ground floor when she arrived there was nothing on the ground  floor we had to put her in a second floor handicap but the shower had a tub  I always thought that a handicap room ment you could walk in and you can bring the wheelchair in with you, well that wasn't the case she had a really hard time trying to get in and out of the tub she almost slipped and when I went down to ask if they had a plastic chairI could put in the tub so she could take a shower I was kind of told no you are in a handicap room nothing else we can do. So I went down to the pool grab a plastic chair brought it up and had her sit down I had to take it upon myself to deal with the situation because they couldn't be bothered. So if you are handicapped you are definitely going to have a hard time getting in and out of the shower they do have handlebars but that's not enough if your 96 years old and you have a hard time lifting your leg to get in the tub. Let's talk about breakfast it was ok  but the tables were dirty I had to go and ask the front desk if someone could please come and clean the tables and the counter where all the food was like the biscuits and gravy and the coffee and the juice it was a mess cereal everywhere look like a storm had been through there and they just didn't bother to clean it up and kids running around everywhere and no place to sit because the tables were all dirty. When she did come out to clean the tables she grabbed the dirty rag that was on top of the garbage can and wipe the tables with I went to the front desk and  and complained that she was using a dirty rag to clean the tables with and he said he would look into it I said a dirty rag does not clean tables you have to have a clean rag with water and Clorox to disinfect this is how you get germs this is how people get sick he just kind of smiled and laughed you must not like germs he said. So ask me if I would ever stay here again the answer is NO NO NO if you do stay here I hope you have a better experience than I did. If the Wyndham Corporation could only read what I just wrote they would probably be appalled but I guess they will never get this message. Only reason why I stayed here was because I wanted the Wyndham rewards but I guess in the future I'll think twice about staying at a Wyndham hotel or I'll check the room before I hand over my credit card.","target_text":"Second thing wrong with this place is my auntie came to visit me and stayed with me on the second floor I had requested a handicap room because she is handicapped and I was told I could have one on the ground floor when she arrived there was nothing on the ground  floor we had to put her in a second floor handicap but the shower had a tub  I always thought that a handicap room ment you could walk in and you can bring the wheelchair in with you, well that wasn't the case she had a really hard time trying to get in and out of the tub she almost slipped and when I went down to ask if they had a plastic chairI could put in the tub so she could take a shower I was kind of told no you are in a handicap room nothing else we can do.

{"text":"I am not sure where to start, I am in town for a funeral and found this on the Wyndham app. I have stayed at several of their properties and many Days Inn and have never experienced anything like this place before. I will start with driving up, it is easy to get to from interstate 81. There are many newer and more appealing hotels in the proximity. The handicap ramp at the entrance is steep and narrow making it dangerous, I would be surprised if it is ADA compliant. Then you see the doors which stick when you try to open them but that is not as bad as the printed signs taped to the window. The one that makes you wonder what kind a place you are staying at was \"we do not rent to locals\". Even after this I hoped it could still be a good stay, nope. I approached the front desk and informed them I had a reservation, I must have interrupted social hour or the sewing circle, cause one gentleman behind the counter was sewing, two others were at the desk eating and the lobby had several people sitting around on their walkers in different levels of consciousness, it was reminiscent of walking into a halfway house or a really bad nursing home. The front desk clerk was curt and abrupt before even willing to speak to me she demanded my ID to ensure I was not a \"local\", im starting to wonder what kind of area I am in. Entering the room it was dated but appeared at least clean, basic up keep such as paint and stains on carpet and chairs was lacking. The TV only had maybe a third of the channels that were listed on the printed channel list and you needed to use the TV to drown out the conversations of the people in the next rooms. The walls were so thin you could here the person in the next room snore, I sneezed at one point and the person in the next room said \"God bless you\". The bathroom was so small you need to stand on the toilet to close the door, the walls there were also thin I could here the person in the next room having a gassy bowel movement. The do not disturb sign meant nothing to the staff that tried to come in very early to clean the room, I guess that was our only shot of getting the room cleaned cause we left at 1130am to go to the service and returned around 7pm to an untouched room. This stay has not only affected my opinion of Days Inn and Wyndham but may make me not stay in another one again.","target_text":"The handicap ramp at the entrance is steep and narrow making it dangerous, I would be surprised if it is ADA compliant.","annotation":"negative"}

This was very disturbing given how sick my poor Coco was . Especially when you can't go in,  and your waiting in the parking lot .\nMy  other problems with Medvet\/ Reach is they do not help people who are on limited income. They don't use a sliding scale. When my Coco was diagnosed with kidney failure a  1 1\/2 weeks ago I rushed her over there. I knew it would be expensive I figured around 1500. They told me she probably had leptospirosis and with antibiotics it could be treated. She hadn't lost that much weight and it hadn't been that long before she stopped eating completely  it was just over the 48-hour period before I had gotten her to my regular vet and he told me she was in kidney failure.\nAt any rate I had my car paid for and was able to refinance it. I would have done anything because I had just lost my cat 3 months before. As a single disabled woman,  caring for her elderly parents  my dog was all I had left to hold on to.\nAfter they got her stable and I brought her home 4th of July weeknd she got worse they gave her something to help increase her appetite but not to help her drink.\nWhen I took her back the following Monday for her labs and I told them I could not finance another two nights in the hospital. They very bluntly\/brutally told me there was no hope. This time they sent her home with some anti-nausea medicine that she was able to drink. She drank so much she threw up .  But she had one good night at home  thinking everything was going to be alright.\nWhen I brought her back home I called my mobile vet made  arrangements for the next day.\nThe mobile vet came and she died peacefully in my arms. Because with covid-19 you can't go in with them and I wasn't going to let her die in that place that was just wanting their money. If you're rich or have money in the bank they will help you.

{"text":"Four stars for being one of maybe two hotels in ocean isles that doesn\u2019t require booking a full week and is oceanfront with indoor and outdoor swimming pools. A few downers are the Pool side tiki bar was closed so no rum runners for me during my 3 night stay, they have a elevator but honestly I used it once and wouldn't get in again but that\u2019s my own issues. All rooms are at least 2 flights of stairs. If you get the rooms on the 2nd floor have your inhaler ready unless you\u2019re a energetic fitness buff. I think I lost weight on vacation. The room was nicely updated with wood floors and a small balcony that was hard to enjoy sitting out on in the evening because the heat that radiates from the air conditioner made it too hot. It would be nice for a cool fall evening to have that warmth. COVID restrictions was not an issue during our stay. I brought my own sheets and pillow cases and towels. Housekeeping could give us more than one large garbage bag If you catch them since we are bringing take out food back to the room for each meal during COVID. I did have to go buy a mop and cleaner after we got unpacked in the room. The babies feet got black 2 minutes after touching the floor. I mopped each day we stayed. So whoever got room 3103 after we left on 7\/8 You\u2019re welcome for the extra clean floor. The pool was nice and not crowded at all but again there was a downfall that the water could have been cleaner. Breakfast was grab and go with employee getting what you wanted from limited continental breakfast list to take back to your room due to COVID restrictions. I actually prefer to take my breakfast to go (please get rid of the policy of no food leaves the breakfast area) I\u2019m paying good money to stay at the establishment and I should have the choice to take my family breakfast in the morning. We are on vacation. Not everyone likes to get out of bed, get dressed to sit among people for a muffin and juice. The walk to the beach has two entrances. Go through the pool area and take the steps or go from the parking lot next to gazebo down the sand path. I had enough steps getting to the room so I took the path to the beach. If you\u2019re\nhandicap and can\u2019t walk steps then I don\u2019t know how you would get to and from the beach safely. The Sand path is narrow with a slight elevation at the top and it\u2019s where the pool shower water runs down that makes a ditch in the sand. Now on to the beach review. Sticks, sticks and more sticks. I didn\u2019t know I should have packed a rake. You can\u2019t lay a blanket on top of stick filled sand. You have to set up where high tide washed the sand clean which is nice but if you\u2019re a all day beach person then be ready to get washed away when it\u2019s high tide time. Overall my stay at the islanders inn was just as expected and since OIB has very limited hotels to book half weeks I would most likely stay at the Islander again. Nice location close to all the main attractions in ocean isles. Walk to get a Italian ice to take with you for a stroll on the pier.","target_text":"handicap and can\u2019t walk steps then I don\u2019t know how you would get to and from the beach safely.","annotation":"negative"}
{"text":"It was time for me to get off of my parents plan (I\u2019m 31) and all three of us all needed to upgrade our phones. Well Kirby Cox came to our car with the whole COVID stuff going on fully equipped with a mask and gloves. I knew I what phone I wanted but my parents who are a little slower when it comes to technology wanted new iPhones but had no idea what models they wanted. My father is going deaf so when Kirby was helping him out he spoke loudly and clearly and not once did my dad struggle hearing or understanding him. You can tell Kirby was a pro helping out senior citizens. My mom on the other hand is someone who asks questions and a ton of them. She explained to Kirby she doesn\u2019t know much if anything about today\u2019s technology. Kirby once again exceeded expectations by not just answering her questions but also \u201cdumbing it down\u201d to where she understood. He also noticed my father was a veteran and found a huge discount for him.  I will recommend Kirby to my friends, family, and anyone who is looking to upgrade or switch phone carrier\u2019s.

I thought my first visit was a one off, but then I had the same problems on my second visit and judging by the other reviews, so do a lot of other people.\n\nThe restaurant was very dirty both times I came. Trash and food on most of the tables, chairs, and floor. I was in there for about 20-30 minutes and not a single employee (out of the 9 I saw working) paid any attention to the lobby. The food on the line had a very poor presentation from the employees scattering food all over the place and not cleaning up between customers. Out of grilled vegetables the first visit and then out of grilled vegetables and steak the second visit.\n\nI've been to many different chipotles, but none run as poorly as this.

{"text":"I love their fair. It\u2019s one of the best!\n\nBut they need to figure out a way to be more rv friendly, at least to small RVs and small trailers. I travel with a small travel trailer in fall and the Columbia county fair is one of the wonderful places I\u2019d love to visit.  My truck and trailer fit easily into 2 parking spaces. I have a couple health challenges where having the little trailer to rest makes visiting fairs much more accessible and manageable for me. Last fall I just asked to stay overnight on night. Their field parking lot is always empty for night. And many campers are always parked their. I\u2019m willing to pay a reasonable amount for just one night. I offered to arrive early so they could park me any where they wanted. But I was told only way I could stay is if I bought a campsite for the entire fair, which is very expensive for one night.  That was ridiculous, for one night. This year I\u2019m coming close enough to arrive in morning and leave at night. So no overnight stay. I emailed just asking if I arrive early could I simply park in 2 lined up spaces as far as they wanted away from their gate. I sent a picture of my truck and camper and the total length of 35 feet. But they emailed back with a very short absolutely not. It\u2019s ridiculous. I have a couple health challenges so the little camper allows me to rest during my visit. I tried to explain this. And I would be moving on to my next destination when gates closed. But they said absolutely not. Heat every year I see dozens of huge rigs parked in the lot. I\u2019m told they are all help and show people. But there is plenty of room. And still they say no.\n\nThey need to figure out a way to be more friendly to small rvers.

We had a group of 8 (lots of potential business for them, including older people who have health issues prohibitive to standing for long periods). There were no tables that would have fit our group in the entire establishment and the bar was packed by young, rowdy people. The restaurant area (mostly tables for four or less) was half empty). We had just eaten lunch as it was about 3 pm. We were IDed on the way in and assumed it was a cool bar so we ordered drinks. After we received our drinks and were sitting at tables the waitress informed us that unless we were planning on ordering food, we should leave the table. This was very awkward and inappropriate as we had not been informed in any way before that we would have to order food. Her attitude was off-putting. We didn't have the option of going to the crowded bar and standing on the concrete floor would have been very painful to the disabled in our group, so we ordered fried pickles.

Makes sense that they're called \"LAZYDAYS.\"\n\nWe bought a brand new camper because we wanted to be able to hit the road and not worry about issues.  With COVID19, we decided to have it delivered.  LazyDays assured us that the camper would be given a thorough check over and that it would arrive as new without any issues.  This couldn't have been further from the truth!  It arrived with numerous problems including a a water system that TOTALLY didn't work, a broken window, and a refrigerator door that would not open.\n\nWe spent hours on the phone with their service tech team to try to help us resolve the water system & ended up having to take it for warranty service.  Again... this is a BRAND NEW CAMPER.\n\nIt's been getting fixed for almost 7 weeks & the communication effort with Lazy Days has completely unproductive & unprofessional.  I tried in vain to talk with the head of the service team and kept getting the same canned reply that everything was \"checked out and worked.\"  Then I made an appointment to speak with the General Manager, who completely blew off our scheduled call.  I later called the receptionist who left a message to remind him of our phone call.  He called and left me a message saying that his morning got crazy.\n\nI then decided to throw in the towel with the dealership and reach out to corporate.  They were equally lazy about making good on sending us a problem camper.  I was just hoping for a small credit to their camp store that might ease the financial sting of paying for a camper we can't use.  She claimed that she \"researched,\" it an said compensation is not warranted due to the items being under warranty.  With Lazy Days, your issues will fall on deaf ears.  Time and time again, they refused to take any responsibly for giving us a camper full of problems.\n\nI have absolutely no doubt one of the other corporate minions will read this review and give a canned reply.

My father is disabled and has trouble walking, but Sam immediately sat us in the closest booth to the door without us having to request it. Being so close to the door, I was able to see that she constantly worked and busied herself with bussing, wiping menus, updating the floor plan while still greeting guests quickly. Our server Kayla was quick, efficient and pleasant. She made sure the timing of my \"appetizer\" (chili that was a side choice) came out with enough time to be enjoyed before our entrees arrived. Maybe 15 mins after ordering our lunch was brought out. She made sure our items were correct and complete, then gave us time to try them and checked back to ensure we liked them. She left us alone to enjoy lunch, but never left us wanting for anything. My steak was cooked perfectly and only needed salt and pepper. My only reason for not rating five stars is the cleanliness of the restrooms. At first glance, they're fine, but upon further inspection you can see the neglect. We arrived two hours after opening and even on a busy lunch they wouldn't have gotten that dirty. I work in a restaurant and I know this doesn't reflect the cleanliness of the kitchen because our bathrooms are just looked over at closing while our bar, dining rooms and kitchen areas are critiqued.

Most of my shopping is done online, this way all your problems are solved.\n\n7\/03\/18 UPDATE\nTo my amazement this Walmart has been upgraded to being a very nice facility here in Eunice. I basically don\u2019t have to step inside the store if I know exactly what I\u2019m needing. The grocery shopping is freaking amazing. I have grocery shopped online twice now and haven\u2019t had once single problem. The wait time for them to bring my groceries to my vehicle has been under a 2 minute wait time. You don\u2019t have to get out your vehicle. They will load you up and your on your way back home. I needed a few\nthings from the plumbing isle and added them to my grocery list. To my surprise they even grabbed non grocery items for me and had them included with my groceries. The pickup area in the front of the store is awesome as well. You will get an email or text when your items are ready for pickup. I just walk into the front where the big orange kiosk is located, let the kiosk scan my phone, and your items are then accessible out of the kiosk or lockers. I didn\u2019t know what them big orange lockers were for until what I ordered was needing to be placed in one. If you order something as big as a 19\u201d old style heavy square tv, then it will be placed in the locker. Either way, the doors will automatically open up for you when you punch in your order number, or scan your phone. I love not having to walk around the store and running into people that I either don\u2019t want to see, or that make my skin crawl because they don\u2019t know how to act as human beings. So much easier to be able to take your time shopping online than walking up and down the isle shopping for your groceries.\nGreat job Walmart!!!!","target_text":"I just walk into the front where the big orange kiosk is located, let the kiosk scan my phone, and your items are then accessible out of the kiosk or lockers.","annotation":"unrelated"}

By Monday he had regained some vision and will continue on with the ointment and should recover full vision in a month.

While she may appear shy, not wanting to draw attention to herself, she is really so vibrant and alive when dealing with all of the residents. Don't let her small stature fool you.

She would give them a kiss and a big bear hug and ask them to give her a big bear hug in return. She asked them to keep hugging her as she transfered them safely. My dear Eldora was in one of her moods, when along came Debra to the rescue. She gave Eldora a big kiss on the forehead, told her she loved her and began singing \"you are my sunshine\", as she knows that is Eldora's favorite song. Before long, Eldora was engaged and singing along and had forgotten that she was in a bad mood. This morning after breakfast, Debra asked Eldora if she would like to sit by the fireplace. Eldora responded \"Yes\", and Debra wheeled her to her favorite destination. I also noticed that Debra was loving to all residents and was constantly watchful to maintain the safety and well being of them all. Recently, I witnessed Debra feeding a resident when she watched another resident begin to get out of their wheelchair. Debra immediately went and helped the resident so they did not fall and get hurt. It is comforting to know that Debra is so dedicated to her job and that my loved one is being well taken care of.

Clean, helpful staff, decent rooms it was cool, but over the years it's clear to see that the management and staff don't really care.\n\nThey discriminate against certain people also the some of the front desk will charge you a ridiculous amount and pocket the extra ... I started off paying 57.95 that is with taxes ... To paying 60.95 basically for the same room i been in sporadically over the years. This place is cheap and it's becoming run down .... The recycle all the linens never get any new linen.  Few areas where they neglect ... Shuttle drive is FULL OF SHI+ ... Computer in the lobby is broke. Breakfast sucks .. It's the same wack stuff waffles and muffins and mini cinnamon rolls nothing i cant get at McDonald or the convenient up the road\n\nOld fruit .. I even see bugs in the cereal sometimes.

{"text":"Recently, we stayed at the Lake Shore Resort for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She is recovering from chemotherapy, so we wanted her to have a nice relaxing weekend away to rest and get some fresh air. We were provided a handicapped cabin.

{"text":"I lived there for six years. One of the main reasons I picked the place was it was pet friendly. Originally the management was courteous and attentive. I watched year by year the changes dropped that original care they had for residents. The final two years, they dropped their standards, and the newer residents got more ghetto as time went. Along with that managers kept getting swapped out till they finally got some in who were actually hostel to any issues or concerns we had. The attitude built until couldn't stand it. They \"outsourced\" every aspect about the property, until they finally had Gonch Towing to verify if a vehicle was \"abandoned\" (and therefore towed) from the property. I had a couple of working, registered, insured, and licensed vehicles (a truck and a car) there. I used both, though not daily. The tow company decided since I didn't use my truck every single day, they would tow it. When I went to the office to ask (no yelling or cursing) what was going on, they claimed they had no responsibility here and had a police officer stand there while I asked what was going on? I guess it was to intimidate me in asking why a vehicle, that is registered in the office, was being towed.) I simply left, and called Beacon Management, the parent company. I got a call from\"Laura\" (the Regional Manager), who proceeds to address me as a trouble maker, and how dare I question her manager! I thought after six years, never late on the rent, did the minor repairs (clogged drain, broken blind, shampooed the carpet, etc.) myself, that asking why they had my truck towed, when new residents came in with some if the rusty, broken windshields, and no insurance vehicles I've ever seen on roads in Michigan, I should be addressed as a trouble maker and need the police to intimidate me from speaking with my landlord, it was time to move. GLADLY. The last act was moving the mail boxes\"out\" of the buildings, and on to an exposed, unlit concrete pad that would be a great place to mug someone or worse, if you are a woman, a child, or less than fit to defend oneself.\n\nIt used to be a great place and convenient location, but lacking management, hostel supervision, a different class of residence (not a racial evaluation, an economic evaluation), and no services, pick them at your own risk.\n\nI switched my mail to a PO box around the corner. Even the post office calls two areas\"the ghetto\": Woodland Apts and Hampton Court Apts.","target_text":"I thought after six years, never late on the rent, did the minor repairs (clogged drain, broken blind, shampooed the carpet, etc.) myself, that asking why they had my truck towed, when new residents came in with some if the rusty, broken windshields, and no insurance vehicles I've ever seen on roads in Michigan, I should be addressed as a trouble maker and need the police to intimidate me from speaking with my landlord, it was time to move.","annotation":"unrelated"}

The manager Richard Craig Dilly was incredibly rude and expelled me quickly after I complained about the hot water and television connections not working. I am physically handicapped and in a wheelchair, yet they put me on the 4th floor in the last room down the hall. This was extremely difficult for me to get in and out.

Between the location and a corporate office, no one has been willing to help even return some of the money. The difficulties I went through while there and the way that I was treated should have this Motel closed by the state. The desk staff were very nice.

{"text":"First off I have been living in this apartment complex for over a year and wish I could give them 0 stars but I can't. Like most people, I rarely write reviews unless a place is extremely bad or was super amazing. This management company is by far the worst I have ever experienced, and I want to save a few people the trouble before they have to live in this hell. I am usually skeptical of reviews because they are usually biased\/have no evidence to back them up. Well I have attached 2 photos just to prove my point that I am not exaggerating.\n\nCustomer Service:\nThe customer service of UDR\/Newport Village is absolutely horrible. I am a non confrontational person and these people make me want to punch a baby. They will nickel and dime you for anything and everything they possibly can. Examples:\n\nPool pass printed construction paper, unlamented with their logo and written expiration date. If you lose this or it gets damaged you have to pay $15 per pool pass. If it is not returned $15.\n\nIf you by chance get married and try to add your spouse to the lease, $600.\n\nTheir online web portal that receives payments is completely broken. They pretty much force you to make payments online, but if you sign in at the wrong time, rent won't be applied to your account and you will be charged a late fee. I brought this up to management and they said it was an issue that many people were having but refused to waive the fee. I had never been late before and told them they needed to fix their system. Still isn't fixed and I have to log in multiple times a day on the 1st to make sure rent is applied. I talked to them in person twice and via email no response.\n\nWhen I confronted Antwan Taylor the person that \"helped me with this issue\" months after the fact he said \"Oh yea I remember you. Yea I don't see how you can hold me accountable because I'm just one man and have to provide service to so many.\" Sorry Antwan, its your job.\n\nMaintenance:\nThings started out fine however there were maintenance issues when I first arrived. (Hanging blinds damaged and never replaced, multiple doors unable to open\/close due to massively thick coats of paint, missing lightbulbs\/lights or lights that were out.)\n\nI thought these things were minor, advised management when I first moved in but no one ever came to fix them. The majority of it was cosmetic and so I just let it go.\n\nWashing machine (NOT THE DRYER) started to smoke and filled the kitchen with haze and smell of burning rubber. Called maintenance they said they would come the next day. They said it was the dryer which wasn't even running. Luckily it was a one off occurrence.\n\nBathroom flooded from the ceiling. Called maintenance they immediately sent someone out to fix the issue and they mostly fixed it that night. There was a hole in our ceiling for 2 days but it eventually got fixed. A month later the flood turned into a flowing waterfall from the ceiling. Called maintenance, and they said they were too busy and would look at it tomorrow. That was 3 days ago and we have pestered them about it with no one coming to look at it. The ceiling in the closet is now bowing and appears to have water damage to the drywall, meaning the flood was probably more severe, and mold is probably growing. I can't verify this it is just my assumption due to the amount of time that is going by without it being fixed.\n\nPests:\nThese apartments are infested with roaches and mice. There are pest control people out multiple times a week and can't seem to keep up with the amount of issues because we have requested them to come and take care of roaches more than 6 times and no one has ever came.\n\nNow it seems that we are experiencing an infestation of mice since it is starting to get colder. In the past 5 days we have caught 6. In the last 24 hours we have caught 3. We have complained to management about this and they don't seem to care since we are moving.\n\nAnyway there are more issues but I'm exceeding the character limit. Hope this helps someone make the choice to stay somewhere else!","target_text":"(Hanging blinds damaged and never replaced, multiple doors unable to open\/close due to massively thick coats of paint, missing lightbulbs\/lights or lights that were out.).","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I absolutely love The Center for Avian & Exotic Medicine!  I have been a loyal customer for over a year and I could not be happier with the services that I have received there.  I adopted a blind pigeon Oct of 2014 and I took him here to give him a check up and to make sure that I was doing the right things as far as feeding and caring for my Stevie.  I have never had a bird or a pet before and I was concerned because Stevie had been  pretty roughed up before I got him so I needed to be sure that the care he was receiving from me was adequate and not harming him in anyway.  Once I got there, I knew I was in the right place!  They took the time to give him a complete and thorough examination and they gave me excellent advice on how to properly care for Stevie.  I have followed their advice and my bird is happy and as healthy as he could possibly be.  I have also used them to board Stevie whenever I go away and I am always satisfied with the care that they provide.  The first time I left him there to board, I was like a sick mama and I called to make sure he was alright and they were so nice about giving me an update on how he was doing which made my trip less stressful since I was nervous about leaving him.  Since that first time, I have boarded Stevie three times and I feel Great about it.  No more worries or care for me because I know that he will be taken care of by professional and caring people.  Now lets talk price,  They are very reasonably priced for the services that they provide and lets be honest, Are our pets not worth any price to make sure that they are healthy and well taken care of.  As I said, I use to think that Vets in general were super expensive but to my surprise this place is reasonable.  Also keep in mind that this place is always spotless and the staff is super professional and so friendly that they make you feel right at home.  Appointment times are awesome, I have never ever waited for any real significant amount of time to be seen or taken care of so no worries there.  As I said, they really are professional and its a pleasure to have a safe environment with people that know what they are doing take care of my most precious possession! Stevie and I are very happy to have found this place and we would never go anywhere else!","target_text":"I adopted a blind pigeon Oct of 2014 and I took him here to give him a check up and to make sure that I was doing the right things as far as feeding and caring for my Stevie.","annotation":"unrelated"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all,  the last two times we have stayed here they have for whatever reason put us in handicap rooms,  with showers and no tub and when talking with them they try to excuse it away.

I have never in my 55 years ever experienced such unprofessionalism.  Most places want to make sure you are satisfied,  not here.

{"text":"Not the best place to live... Prices are too expensive for apartment units that aren't all that appealing. The units are poorly made and managed. The walls in the units are so paper thin\nthat neighbors are easily heard (phone calls, dishes, laundry) everything is heard! The a\/c units suck and struggle to cool off and maintain a decent temperature during the warm summer days. The heaters are equally as terrible and failed to keep our unit heated (we had a one bedroom as well as a two bedroom and neither was successful). It bewildered me that our electricity bill was insanely and unexplainabley high. We are not a family who utilizes much electricity so at first we figured it was a malfunction in our one bedroom unit, then we moved to our two bedroom unit and it was still so uncontrollably high. Throughout a majority of the 2 years I lived here the hot tub was broken.The location is not desirable either, a lot of homeless wander through complex and lurk in the dumpster areas. I personally had to call three times on accounts of a homeless man staying in a vacant unit and another homeless man banging on windows and trying to unlock doors in the middle of the night. Additionally, being located right next to Daily's meat factory there is a constant undesirable strong odor during all times of the year. Lastly, I will review the staff. I was not impressed with their service whatsoever due to their unproffessionalism. The office staff were catty women who have been  overheard by myself and my family members gossiping about tenants. When calling or going into the office to inquire about a question or concern they were generally unhelpful and had attitude. I once went into the office to print something and the printers were not working so I requested help from the woman at the second desk in the office and she huffed and sighed the entire time; not a desirable or friendly way to represent your job. Upon retrieving a package from the office the staff did not bother to pause their inappropriate conversation regarding clubbing and hooking up experiences. They also demand you have your dogs leashed yet they turn a blind eye to the maintenance worker who brings his large Akita to work and keeps him unleashed at all times. On the topic of dogs, there is a copious amount of dog poop all throughout the lawn areas. In conclusion, this is certainly the worst place I have ever experienced living at and I strongly urge you to consider a residence elsewhere.","target_text":"They also demand you have your dogs leashed yet they turn a blind eye to the maintenance worker who brings his large Akita to work and keeps him unleashed at all times.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"So I don't ever write reviews but I felt inclined to after playing the course on sunday 2\/24\/18. I am going to break this down into a couple parts. I am 5 handicap and play a lot of golf...\n\nGolf Course: The golf course itself is 5 star in my opinion. It is very forgiving off the tee as they have taken out a lot of trees and replaced them with a lot of bunkers. The overseeded fairways are incredible and something you rarely see in DFW. I do wonder how long they will keep that up for over the years going forward. The greens are very good(minus a few bare spots and then #6 is struggling but they are new) and very undulating. Definitely has some hints of Ditto coming down the stretch(16-18) which I enjoyed. 8 of us played and the overall consensus is we all loved the course...\n\nNow to the cost...\n\nSo I worked in the private golf club space for 7 years and have experience playing a lot of nice clubs during my golfing life. Right now(no clubhouse so that could change my opinion) for the non Arlington resident or non arlington golfer $120 is too high. This will be a once or twice a year course for your average golfer.  And for people working at the club reviewing this take it with a grain of salt because you guys just opened and maybe you will be tweaking things but....\n\n- No water in the carts (gotta have that for $120)\n- No club cleaner on the carts or on the range\n- No one cleaning clubs at the end of the round\n- Add music to the range, people love to hit balls and listen to music\n\nThese are all little things but they make the difference and I have some more but I don't want to keep going lol, bottom line is the golf course is incredible and a lot of fun to play but for your average golfer that loves to play, they will go down 30 to Waterchase all day.\n\nLove the course, hope to play it again just maybe not on my dime :).","target_text":"I am 5 handicap and play a lot of golf..","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Please read!!!!! Guys please take the time to read this! I read so many bad reviews before staying here and I thought to myself \u201coh they probably just had a bad experience, it won\u2019t happen to me\u201d Well, I was wrong, and I don\u2019t want the same thing to happen to you. Now keep in mind that I have never ever been the type of person to complain about any type of customer service. So, I booked my stay over the phone so that I couldn\u2019t be blindsided at all! Talked to a real person to make sure that I got ALL of the information. As soon as I got there I was told that there was an extra 100 dollar deposit that I was not previously warned about. Nevertheless, I paid it. The girl that checked me in told me that the valet parking was 45 a night so 10 dollars out of the 100 would be refunded to me. After the first day I had to call at 6 pm just for them to come and change the sheets and the towels in my room, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have done it. There were two tiny windows in the room that only had enough room to see the building under construction next door. Fast forward two days, I am trying to check out, and am being told that it was actually 100 dollars for the valet, not 90, so now I don\u2019t get any of that deposit back. And on top of that they have charged me another 100 dollar fee for dinner that I had paid for 2 nights prior to my check out date. After letting them know that I didn\u2019t have those funds in my account they told me that I was not able to leave until it was paid for. I was blindsided not once, but twice by them. My whole stay ended up being 200 dollars more than it was supposed to be, and that would have been fine if it was worth it, but honestly this hotel was not worth it at all.","target_text":"So, I booked my stay over the phone so that I couldn\u2019t be blindsided at all!

{"text":"Stayed 3 nights ago. We are Titanium Marriott Bonvoy Members and requested & confirmed our guaranteed 4pm late check-out with the front desk, as I was having surgery for a broken ankle that afternoon and we didn't want to take the wheelchair, the knee scooter, etc. with us to the hospital with no vehicle in one trip.\n\nThe hubby left the hospital while I was being operated on, and arrived at the hotel around 3pm to find our room wide open with the maid wheeling my brand new expensive knee scooter down the hall, to who knows what demise. Glad he saw it before it was gone forever, because a bunch of the rest of our things had been \"thrown away\" including my husband's insulin (though I suspect the maid actually stole the rest of the items because they were brand new, including some sage, some blessed candles for my surgery and recovery, some expensive healing crystals, etc.).\n\nMy husband complained to the general manager about not only the intrusion into our room before our confirmed 4pm check-out time, but also the theft\/disposal of our things.

{"text":"I'm going to preface this review by saying that all clubs in Las Vegas are awesome. They are the best of the best from whatever city they originally came from and they are definitely far better and more accessible than any club in any city you might be from. That being said these clubs typically tend to be pretentious and way overly expensive.  On The Record is unlike these other clubs in that it is not pretentious and it doesn't make you wait till 3:00 a.m. to see whomever is performing for a mere 15 minutes. Now yes it's overpriced but the drinks are more than worth it if you order smart. (Order something from the dead rabbits Jillian!) I am not even over exaggerating when I that this is going to be the new Las Vegas hot spot and it will have none of the bad things you'd normally associate with that title. This place is all about the music and fun! They have a private vinyl listing room and several karaoke rooms for and your friends to just enjoy music and have fun in classic Vegas style! This is my new favorite place to end the night in Las Vegas and keep in mind that if you roll up on a Saturday night there is going to be a long line and you're going to have to wait... but I promise it'll be well worth it and you will leave with a smile on your face and a story to tell.","target_text":"They are the best of the best from whatever city they originally came from and they are definitely far better and more accessible than any club in any city you might be from.","annotation":"unrelated"}
{"text":"ONE Word to describe my experience at MOGO Auto Service Center today, July 27, 2015:  OUTSTANDING!\n\nIt is so refreshing to find an HONEST place to be able to take my car!  Cudos to George and his Service Tech, Don, who actually seemed like they cared about me and my safety; so much so, I felt like I should of HUGGED them before leaving!!  That's how THRILLED I am to have found this place!\n\nWhile I went there for a battery issue on an older car, I also asked them to look at my front driver's side tire that I have to put air in every few days.  ...They didn't try to sell me a new tire, In fact, told me my tires looked OK.  ...They told me it was a rim-leak and would cost $3x.xx to fix --FAR LESS than a new tire, and to bring it in whenever I had the money.\n\nWhat's sad is, I've lived in Westlake for over 15-years before discovering MOGO's today, and actually thought they were a Auto\/RV Stereo Dealer by their logo\/signage.  I had no idea they're the \"Hidden Gem\" of true and honest car repair!\n\nI have always felt ripped-off by the \"national chains\" who seem to say, \"Well, we can fix 'that', but you also need 'this, that, and another' thing done\"; and then get annoyed when I say I can't afford it.  Same Car, 3-4 years ago, One National Chain, 3-Letters, sales said, \"Well, it's YOUR safety, ma'am.  I wouldn't drive that car without having 'This, This and That done.\"  ...Years later, I STILL haven't had \"This, This, and That\" done and I'm still alive and the car is fine!!\n\nI got none of that \"crap\" from MOGO\/George today!  All he said was, when you have a little extra money, lets get that tire fixed, and maybe allow us to take a look at the cause of that clinky sound when your car hits a bump!  --OH, the reason he knew that is because he took it for a test drive!  And Yes, I'm handicapped, but he wanted to make sure my car was safe for me to drive!!\n\nI truly can't give anything but praise and 10+ Stars to the service I received at MOGO today!\n\nL Collins, Westlake, OHIO","target_text":"And Yes, I'm handicapped, but he wanted to make sure my car was safe for me to drive!!.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Well I walked into Tomball Pawn and purchased a Ruger GP100 and had a very smooth experience. No complaints for my initial purchase! I then proceeded to Email them the following week inquiring about the Ruger LCP in which I received no response at all! Three weeks later I renegotiated my decision and went with the Ruger SR9 compact, Great pistol by the way! This is the bad experience, I bought it brand new and noticed that the 17rd. extended magazine was not together with the box. I then questioned if they had it which they did not. I was told that they would order it for me since it is supposed to come with the pistol and by the end of my transaction (ALL SALES ARE FINAL AT THIS POINT) I asked for a receipt for the 17rd. extended magazine so they have reference that they owe me this part and was told I would get a receipt when I came back in to pay for it. Miss-communication? maybe...All in all, I like the shop and many people mention them for purchasing firearms, BUT this transaction left a bad feeling.\n\nThe next day, after my buddy saw my new SR9c, we took a ride over to purchase a black one they had (I had already bought the stainless) and they stated they had already sold it. I then asked about the 17rd. clip they were supposed to inquire about price for, and they said \"We said we would call you on Monday\" To make a long story short, THEY LIED!!! All around took me for an idiot and basically ripped me off. I am not upset about having to pay extra for the magazine and adapter, however just really read the body language of the guy who decided it would be OK to rip a GREAT customer off and also wouldn't make eye contact with me. Really a pathetic attempt to make an extra couple of bucks. If I really wanted to push the issue I could have spoken with the owner and tried to clarify matters but arguing in a gun store where some of the personnel are holding a barely concealed pistol in their pants pocket wasn't exactly how I wanted to spend my day. For this reason, I took my friend over to Academy right across the road and gave him the extra 10 bucks to buy the SR9 at Academy, (since they claimed the compact wasn't in stock anymore and all they had was the full size at Tomball Pawn). Not only did they lose a 440.00 purchase but I was also going to buy the Smith and Wesson M&P 15 .22 (520.00) which I am now going to purchase at Academy. So, inevitably, just handing me the 40 dollar difference for the extended rd. magazine, cost them about 1000.00 bucks in revenue for the day! GREAT JOB TOMBALL PAWN...Go back and take a course in business! Lesson number one! The customer is always right, and in this case, I was, as it states in the dag on owner's manual that it comes with a 17rd. extended clip!\n\nConclusion: I would probably stop back in to make a purchase in the distant future, BUT I would definitely check everything out before I pull out my payment method! And I will never show those kids behind the counter any respect for handgun knowledge again, as it is obvious they only know a little about the market and cannot contest to my only 3+ months of studying and learning about handguns. I'll admit I am very studious when it comes to anything and would never walk into any new hobby blind, but 3 months of reading and checking reviews and such and I'm supposed to be the rookie and I knew more about logistics, model numbers, recalls and equipment facts than they did!\n\nThey will get one star for inventory and another star for the fact that once I get over the fact that they pulled a fast one, I can see myself heading back in to make another purchase. My only advice would be to just do your own homework and DO NOT ask for their opinion, as they're knowledge of the trade is awful, make sure you are getting what you are supposed to get and you should have a good experience!","target_text":"I'll admit I am very studious when it comes to anything and would never walk into any new hobby blind, but 3 months of reading and checking reviews and such and I'm supposed to be the rookie and I knew more about logistics, model numbers, recalls and equipment facts than they did!.","annotation":"unrelated"}
{"text":"Olshan Foundation Repair fixed the water intrusion problem in my basement. They handled every aspect of the project from start to finish. I was so happy to find a company that does it all. Since I am fairly new to the area, it would have been very difficult to find multiple contractors to handle the various aspects of the job. Also, I don\u2019t have the technical knowledge to understand the numerous things needed to be done to correct the problem.\nHiring Olshan Foundation Repair was not a matter of just putting my trust in luck. When I called Olshan on the phone, I spoke to Tammie and Jessica to explain my problem. They were both so nice and patiently listened to my \u201cbellyaching\u201d. You simply can\u2019t ask for better customer service.\nTammie and Jessica scheduled a gentleman named Keith to come out and evaluate my basement water leak. Keith took the time to point out and explain how water was getting into my basement. He explained everything in a way that I could understand and made me feel informed with a new sense of knowledge about the problem at hand. After his evaluation, he quickly emailed an estimate to me. I felt good about approving the estimate and signing the contract after Keith\u2019s thorough explanation of my basement water leak problem and what Olshan would do to rectify the situation. Keith is a certified structural technician who gave me a good understanding of everything that needed to be done. It\u2019s a great feeling to know you are dealing with a knowledgeable contractor and are not taking a blind leap of faith on hiring a repair company.\nOnce I approved the estimate, a crew was quickly dispatched to repair the water leak in my basement. One thing I was thrilled about with the repair job, was it was done from the outside of the house rather than in my basement. Absolutely no dirt or mud was tracked into my house. As the project was finishing up, Keith came out to inspect every detail of the job. That extra effort gave me added peace of mind about Olshan\u2019s quality of work. Upon completion of the job, the crew cleaned up around my house and no mess was left. Olshan Foundation Repair is a first class company and I would recommend them with no hesitation for any basement waterproofing or foundation repair work.","target_text":"It\u2019s a great feeling to know you are dealing with a knowledgeable contractor and are not taking a blind leap of faith on hiring a repair company..","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my friend who has been living here for more than six months. The area where she lives in is dark and creepy. We have seen shady looking characters hanging around the area at night and smoking pot. She has constantly reminded the management to fix the lights but they have so far been deaf to her requests. The situation has become so worse that it is hard for her to come out at night sometimes. Plus there is a fence which separates the apartment complex from another, and it has a big hole in it; people come and go freely through there. Of course the management has done nothing so far to handle this. Again the ventilation in the bathroom is bad and whenever the people in the same building smoke pot and such, it fills her whole apartment. It has happened many times and once we had to call the police because she couldn't sleep because of the smell and the management said they couldn't do anything to help her.\nI would advise potential customers from avoiding this place unless you want to live in a constant fear of getting mugged or shot.

{"text":"It was a horrid experience!!!  From the time of check-in we were assigned an upstairs unit. I called twice in advance to make sure we were getting a downstairs unit because of my elderly parents. I was reassured downstairs but upon arrival we got the brush off and sorry we can\u2019t accommodate that request. So, like the good people we are we just took a deep breath and said we would make do. We get to the room and unpack, making several upstairs and downstairs trips! Then we ran to the store to get groceries for our stay, so we weren\u2019t eating out all the time. By the time we got back to the room it was 8 in the evening and all we wanted was to eat and go to bed from our long drive and rest up for the rest of our stay. Well, the first pot we grabbed had some kind of science experiment in it because when you took off the lid, the smell was enough to make you gag!!! Dinner got put on hold!! We called the front desk and they finally came with a cleaned pan. After they replaced pan, we got to looking a little closer at things!! More dirty dishes!! A spatula that looked like someone wanted to see how bad they could heat it up and warp it and then attempt to scrape a pan out with it because it still had food melted into it!! Then we noticed the faucet was so loose in the kitchen sink we were afraid to use it for fear of it falling off and spraying water everywhere!! The bottom drawer of the stove had beacon grease in it along with bits of beacon pieces, lord knows how long that was there!! Then we noticed a handful of lint hanging from dryer vent, clearly had not been wiped down!! One of the blind pieces was broke laying in the floor!! An old used water bottle under the night table in the room!! So clearly Westgate CARES policy doesn\u2019t mean a thing when it says it cares for the safety of its guest or members!! Because it was obvious this unit was not cleaned!! So, I messaged the front desk about all these well below operating standards and I was told to let the cleaning crew know what I had found. I politely requested a manager show up immediately, so they could tell their cleaning crew what they needed todo because clearly there is a huge break in communication, from a highly paid executive who is putting out how much Westgate Employees care about the safety and well being of their customers and members on their website through Westgate CARES policy, and between the one who actually cleans their property!! So, the faucet got fixed later that night and we are exhausted staying up waiting for the cleaning crew. Then a manager shows up who is nothing more that the night receptionist to apologize and that the cleaning crew will be in the next morning and if we could be out of our unit so they could clean. YES! I said so they could clean!! Cause they didn\u2019t have enough time to get it done when we weren\u2019t there, now we have to be inconvenienced on our vacation!!! So we were told that the manager wanted to see us in the morning so we go to bed thinking all will be taken care of in the morning. WRONG!!!! So they half-heartedly apologized and wanted to know when we were talked to last about Westgate\u2019s deals!! We said nobody had. They tried to get us to buy something!! We said we want a downstairs unit! And that we had family stuff to do. Well the sales staff finally got us approved to a downstairs unit after telling us about their great new fancy smancy plans!! We finally left to go pack up and move our stuff back to the vehicle with many trips downstairs and upstairs!! They didn\u2019t even bother to offer any help or assistance!! I understand why because of the pandemic but that didn\u2019t stop them from putting us in a possible contaminated unit that clearly wasn\u2019t wiped down nor sanitized!! The second unit had some kind of dust balls stuck in the bedroom blinds!! We had to call front desk about that!! The tub didn\u2019t drain!! And more dirty dishes and shower head clogged! Wouldn\u2019t recommend!! Hope this helps!! We were not treated like a priority!!","target_text":"One of the blind pieces was broke laying in the floor!!

Mom did not find something that she liked that was in her price range.\n\nMegan offered to go get the book so we could look at the full inventory that was available.  Mom found something that she liked.  Megan helped us order the lamp to be delivered to the house.  It was a great experience for both mom and I.  This young girl spent time with us, did not express any frustration over mom's  indecision, and did not hurry us out of the store when we were done.  In fact she even wheeled mom out of the store via a ramp so mom did not have to walk down the steps.

{"text":"edit: newest problem, potential bedbug infestation! since being woken by the upstair's neighbor's furniture crashing against my patio on its way to the ground floor, courtesy of apartment maintenance, i have been plagued by bedbugs. when i asked the apartment manager about their policy regarding bedbugs, apparently first my apartment would be inspected at my cost (about $35), then if evidence of bedbugs is found (besides the several i killed and am now preserving in rubbing alcohol) treated at my cost (to the tune of several hundred dollars). my lease is up in a few months and i intend to move, and i am a disabled veteran on a fixed income who, after paying bills, has maybe $200 to spend on food and gas for the month). i can't afford to treat this problem myself, and don't understand why this isn't covered by pest control...especially because as far as i can tell, the source of the infestation is probably the newly vacated apartment and its filthy bedding. not to mention if one unit in this building has this problem, it will quickly spread to the whole building...especially considering how rapidly they spread from that apartment to mine.\n\nthis is, quite literally, the worst apartment i've ever lived in to date. last year, one pool didn't open until the first of july, remained open for only one week, then closed again. the other one did not open and was a brilliant green for most of the summer, a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes. speaking of, the pest problems that i have encountered\/ heard about since i moved here are: cockroaches, mice (not in my apartment, but in the one directly above me), opossums (ground floor), fleas, bedbugs, rat or mouse mites, paper wasps, and carpenter ants. it took the new management 6 months to find a pest control company, and non-emergency maintenance is low priority. i have mostly had to rely on self-treating. half the electrical outlets don't work correctly, the exit gate is broken and has been for a while (despite tenants having had to pay for a gate key), which makes the only way in\/ out the entry gate, most of the machines in the laundromat don't work (i go to an outside laundromat; it's cheaper and the machines work better), and the crime rate is fairly high. last winter pipes froze in many of the buildings, either because people didn't drip faucets at night, or because there weren't enough tenants to make a difference, and water was lost in many buildings for at least 3 days. management ended up opening up a bathroom in one of the sample units for myself and other tenants to shower in during that time. apparently drug dealers and prostitution are also a problem at the corner market near the entry.

{"text":"Sadly, the property we rented at 12 Port-A-Prince in Shipyard on Hilton Head Island from these people was the worst experience we have dealt with in the many years we have been coming down here.  We rented the house for 10 days and paid extra to have the pool heated. After a long drive from New York, we were hoping to enjoy the pool and some wine, but that was not to be. There was a sign saying not to use the pool for 24 hours due to the chemicals that were put in there. From there the nightmare continued and we needed the wine! Upon entering the house we found damage, ranging from minor to mid- major, to dirty appliances, and a general look of a very run down house. Broken blinds on the windows, dividers on the windows falling off, no screens on the sliding glass doors, soiled bed linens and blankets, stinky shoes hanging from an air conditioning vent, gouges out of the hardwood floor, a leaky refrigerator causing the floor to heave in spots, no ice maker, no covered garbage can in the kitchen or any bathrooms and the best... the refrigerator in the garage full of rotting food. I made the call to the rental agency and started to list all the issues when the young lady said she would come out and see, which she did.  She seemed completely unimpressed with the many issues we pointed out. Here I will add the only bright spot dealing with these people. Their Maintenance staff tried their best to fix what they could and apologized for what they could not due to \" financial issues\".  We made the best of it as we could and then ...back to the pool.  Absolutely filthy with dirt and green slime. Again the young lady from VRP seemed unimpressed and we did the best we could cleaning it until the pool people came again, 3 days before we left for home. We actually spent very little time in the pool, instead visiting with family members and using their's. We were supposed to be \"compensated\"  for our issues but so far have seen nothing. I will attach some photos lest you think I exaggerate. We obviously will never do business with this company again and I hope you think twice before you rent this property.

{"text":"Busch Gardens is truly wonderful place, if not a must see, for locals and tourists to visit. In my experience there, it's often best to come very soon after they open especially during the holiday season due to how long the lines get and how crowded the park becomes about an hour or two after opening. My only critiques are that the food and merchandise are a bit over priced, and the lines can be a bit tedious if you don't have a quick que fast pass, but I think it is fair to say that the experience is truly fantastic.\n\nThere are quite a few areas that younger children would enjoy, namely the Sesame Street area, the Land of the Dragons in Germany, and a few kiddie rides sprinkled around the park, but other than that if your child is under 4 or 5 there isn't much for them to do and can lead to them getting bored so please watch out in that regard. It's quite wheel chair friendly given the hilly terrain it was built upon, but there are some areas that are simply a hassle for wheelchair bound folk to get around, for example getting to the Rhine River Cruise or certain parts of Germany and Octoberfest. The skyrides located in Germany, France and England make getting around the park quite a bit easier if you don't mind waiting in line, especially twords the end of the day when your feet eventually start to get sore. Also in regard to making getting around the park easier, they also have a train system that stops in Scotland, New France, and Festa Italia.\n\nEvery year or two they seem to add something new, so any experience you may have had a couple of years ago may not do the park justice, which only drives folks to want to visit more. They have a lovely selection of roller coasters, a few water rides, and smaller rides like the merry go round, bumper cars, teacups, trade wind, battering ram, and Mach tower, not to mention the amount of game stalls where you can earn prizes like giant stuffed animals. There are multiple stores in ever country which offer clothes, candy, food, accessories, sculptures, and merchandise such as stuffed animals and toys for kids. They also have stations in most of the countries where you can get Starbucks and others where you can get face paint and henna done.\n\nI strongly believe there is something here for ever one. No matter your age, height, or interests, there is bound to be something here that you will at least like. To conclude, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is fantastic place that I highly recommend for taking the entire family to or even just as a fun date.","target_text":"It's quite wheel chair friendly given the hilly terrain it was built upon, but there are some areas that are simply a hassle for wheelchair bound folk to get around, for example getting to the Rhine River Cruise or certain parts of Germany and Octoberfest.","annotation":"neutral"}

Everything from minor cuts and scrapes to sprains or a possible illness you just walk in and can get quickly diagnosed, remedied, advised, and on your way.\nThere\u2019s almost no wait time, too!\n\nThe staff puts you at ease so much, their scrubs just make them look like spa employees!  And they\u2019re down to earth and cordial, they just want what\u2019s best for you whether it\u2019s medicine or a holistic remedy you already have at home.\nIf you have a medical concern and you genuinely don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with yourself, start hear. They can always refer you up the ladder and tell you where you should go from there. Really its the best place to start if you don\u2019t have a primary care provider of your own.\nThe staff are trained through technical colleges, so they are literally the new first line of defense for the modern age. An accessible degree, good job, helping people and ultimately saving lives.

{"text":"DO NOT RENT FROM HERE IT WOULD BE THE WORST MISTAKE\nWe moved in at the beginning of February and everything was ok. My son was watching my dog, until his service animal paperwork came in. He needed me to take his dog and mine for a little bit because his apartment was being sprayed for bugs on a Monday. I took the dogs to the dog park and I came back to apartment to get my mail. Instead of leaving the dogs in the car I walked them down to the mailbox. My sons dog leash broke and he ran and jumped on someone that was walking by. The guy said that the dog bit him, however, this dog had NEVER bitten anyone and his pants were not torn. I think what happened was the dog jumped on him and his nail went through his pants and basically scratched him.  Well the dog had to go into quarantine for 10 days, and then on that Thursday the apartment complex served me with an eviction notice and said that we had to be out within the week. I tried to talk to the office manager and she said the paperwork is already in process and there was nothing she could do. I found an apartment and needed a few more days to stay. I emailed them with no response and my husband called and no one returned his calls. The next Friday when we were planning on moving the new place needed a rent verification and sent something to Berkshire, but again they did not respond back them either. My husband went to the office on that Friday and they said that we could stay but had to show that the dog was put down and my daughter had to fill out an application because she had just turned 18. Financially the move to this apartment took everything we had, and my son knew we could not afford to move. So, we did what they asked and we made a very hard choice but had to do what we had to do and that was putting the dog down. Well not even a week later they said that my daughter application was denied because she had a misdemeanor for theft when she was younger. The office manger told my daughter that she could not be on the premises at all! where in the hell would by daughter go? Well thank God the apartment that we looked at a week prior was still available\n\nWe did what they asked and they still basically kicked us out. They were very rude about the whole situation and all we did was cooperate with them.

I\nwas there the second time and the PT spent 20 minutes and that includes putting on my husbands shoes.\nHe can\u2019t walk without shoes because he had a stoke and needs them to walk well. pT walked him about 15 feet, came back, put him in a chair and left.

{"text":"I\u2019ve lived in College Towne East for over a month now. Our leasing agent was Madelyn Said, and I was very impressed by her professional behavior and support. She was very nice, and took her time to explain all the details of the lease. Even after we signed the lease, she\u2019s been very supportive when it comes to any issues or details we are involved in. Most of the staff is friendly, but there are a couple who have attitude and aren\u2019t very nice. One particular person seems to show resentment to me every time I call about a question, and I\u2019m not sure why.. it makes me very uncomfortable every time I\u2019m on the phone with her. It\u2019s because of this that I\u2019ve removed a star from the reviews. The reason I removed another star was unfortunately because of maintenance. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re short staffed at the moment or have a ton of work orders, but they have not taken care of our past two requests, one being as old as 2 weeks and the other a week old. I\u2019m disabled, and in the end had to take care of one of the work orders on my own, which was difficult but somehow manageable. Aside from the staff, I was very impressed during move in as our apartment was spotless. The kitchen and living room are very spacious, but the bedrooms could be a little bigger. I do wish there was a walk in closet but my closet fits enough clothes and I have a dresser. Overall, for the price, this apartment complex is worth renting. Once maintenance starts responding to my requests, I\u2019ll change my review.

Though, it may have; websites often don't obtain updated information very quickly, such as when a place, of business, etc., shuts down, changes its name, etc. I went here for a Saturday morning breakfast. The food was good. It was quite busy with to many slow `clients`; elderly, disabled, whatever. I finished eating immediately before the end of breakfast & I had to go to the bathroom. So, I'm in there for less than a minute, literally...less than 60 seconds, & some angry psychopath starts pounding on, & screaming at me through, the door...\n\nNow, I don't know if this idiot had to go, too; but, they made no mention of it. I made no mention, to anyone, of my intention of dropping a 'deus' and I didn't think, until that instant, that doing so may have been a good idea; though, I failed then, as I do now, in understanding how it would have been appropriate in bringing up such a thing! I informed them of the situation, politely, including the reality that I was going to be as long as I was going to be. This seemed to make them even more hostile, violently, pounding on the door, while cursing, threatening me, & screaming like a savage...\n\nThey even said that if I didn't come out of the bathroom immediately that they would come through the door and throw me out of the window!\n\nI finished, gathered myself together & made my way out into hallway. And I encountered this individual a few feet up the hallway talking trash to a few other ppl, perhaps all of them were ppl who just volunteer their time at the church. In any case, the guy that had been pounding on the bathroom door continued to threaten me. This time he said that he was going to drag me out into the street & beat me up if I didn't leave immediately. I agreed to leave & put up no resistance; I however did reiterate my 'need' to go & how they were behaving in a disgusting manner. They continued to curse & scream & threaten, clearly not interested in reality...\n\nThey did all of this in front of the other ppl that were there, clearly not interested in how they were behaving or in the reality that they were a far, FAR, far bigger disturbance than I was!\n\nThen, as I am walking out the door, they threatened to call the police if I didn't leave immediately; this, I admit, pushed me a little to far. I didn't do anything wrong! They were, clearly, making the situation worse, into a, disgustingly offensive, altercation. They were wrong, I knew it and I was filled with a desire to refuse to leave... At least until the police arrived.\n\nSo, I turned around & smiled & said...\n\n\"Do it! Call. The. Police. Right. Now.\"\n\nAt that point...the look on their face told me that what they needed was a diaper change...\n\nAnd they reached over and grabbed a 2x4, a piece of wood that was approximately two inches by four inches & about three feet long, that was leaning in the corner of that end of the hallway next to where they were standing & stood there with that same look, dripping from their face!\n\nThey quivered & shook like they were having a seizure. I smiled & said that I would be back on some Saturday, as I saw fit. They said that I was \"banned from the church\", as if they were someone to make such a decision about anyone.

My car has been broken into, and it just so happened that they were painting the next morning, and instead of trying to alert me that my car was clearly robbed, the painters just threw a tarp over it. When I asked why no one tried to alert me, they said my plates \"didn't populate in their system\" even though I've had the same car since I moved in and it is in the system. My partner and I don't really feel safe here, even though we love the place itself. I will say they've finally made some real effort to curb the break-ins, but it's happened too many times for comfort.\n\nMy apartment is beautiful and exactly what I wanted, but when I moved in, it was filthy and everything was broken. My feet got dirty as I walked around on my floor, there was hair in my drawers, and the tubs and sinks didn't drain.

It was broken and smelly.\n\nThe reason I'm still giving four stars after all of this is because Cody, the leasing agent we have been working with since before we signed, was just as appalled as I was and had everything fixed promptly. He called me several times throughout the week to make sure that everything was done, and done right. He had my place cleaned again twice. He also said he'd replace my bedroom ceiling fan if it starts making noise again and continues to keep me awake.

He trained at Duke, arguably the best cornea program in the world, and has an award in his name for most innovative ophthalmic docs in the world. What does this mean?! This means that Dr. Dastgheib, at such a young age, was curing eye diseases and conditions that his alma mater recognizes his work each year with an award to other innovative doctors. These named awards are typically set up posthumously after a lifetime of work, but not in this case. Dr. Dastgheib has done so much for ophthalmology that he\u2019s already recognized with a named award.\n\nI\u2019ve sent several friends and family to Dr. Dastgheib.

{"text":"My name is Darryl and I am a 53 year old disabled man on social security for 9 years. I had two surgeries in 2006. I had a neck fusion and back fusion and after that I got even worse. I have been in this pain clinic for 14 months and I have had 8 injections in my neck and back. On January 16th I had a injection done on my back by Chad Lee and I was ready to go home. I'm always scheduled on the day that my pain medicine is due which is a supply for the next 30 days but they wouldn't give me my pain medicine prescription and nobody was telling me why. There was only one person in the office to wheel me out to my car and he told me everyone was out to lunch so nobody could help me get my prescription. I was not given the pain medicine I have been taking for 16 years. I guess lunch was more important than an established patient. The next day I called the office manager Lauren and she said that she couldn't discuss it over the phone and that I would have to come in for another office visit and pay for another co-pay. I think they are all about the money and injections instead of caring for their patients. As I sit here in chronic pain I have to wait for my discharge letter and its been three weeks since i have requested it along with my MRI reports and medical records. After those three weeks I finally got my MRI reports and medical records, but no discharge letter so I still cant even go to another pain clinic. They have neglected me by making me wait even longer for a discharge letter and are not allowing me to obtain proper medical treatment.","target_text":"My name is Darryl and I am a 53 year old disabled man on social security for 9 years.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Age 45.  I got started with Dialed Health after hearing Derek Teel on a podcast or two talking about strength training and mobility specific to the needs of cyclists.  What hooked me in is that his training and programs build workouts around the endurance work that many cyclists already pile on during the week.  Also, my goals of getting stronger, being able to move better, prevent injury, recover well and just live healthier and positively are all supported by the specific kind of training programs he offers.\n\nSo, about 2-3 months in I can see and feel my body changing for the better and my riding has truly jumped a level or two.  I already find myself hitting bigger rides, often 3K of climbing in on seriously technical trails and feel like I'm ready for part 2.  I am finding that I'm attacking terrain, faster, and finishing descents sharp.  I know it's because I'm moving better and applying pressure and leverage using more of my body and not fading or fatiguing as much.\n\nThe program makes it simple, no gimmicks, just sound, straightforward coaching and a ton of content accessible which makes it easy to integrate into my daily\/weekly routine.  A podcast here or there, some online video guided workouts to just pick from to supplement rides, or if I want to go all in, there are a ton of detailed plans and content if I wanted to get really specific.\n\nIf you've read this much, you must be somewhat interested.  In addition to great, organized content, the owner\/operated, Derek is a really good guy and one heck of a bike rider and fit athlete.  His content is super entertaining which helps a lot.  His positive attitude and work ethic on the bike and in the gym are contagious.  As a happily married dad of two kiddos who just loves to ride and feel good, I'm pretty stoked to pretty much have a 6-pack going again at middle age.  That's kinda cool.  And speaking of 6-packs, beer had become my hobby and vice for the past 5-10 years.  Something I didn't expect is that lately even though one or two post-ride is great, I find myself passing on extra beer and junk food, just because it feels so damn good to be on track.  Feeling good and living 'dialed' is so much more satisfying than that third IPA for the third time in a week!\n\nCheck it out.  I'm sure you'll be pretty stoked you did. #dialedfamily","target_text":"The program makes it simple, no gimmicks, just sound, straightforward coaching and a ton of content accessible which makes it easy to integrate into my daily\/weekly routine.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Update: After trying their rib tips, I've found a new favorite menu item. The rib tips are covered in enough sauce to reach the fries that are served at the bottom (just how I like it- sauce on the fries!). The tips have plenty of meat on them, and they're cooked perfectly (a little char on the outside for flavor)! I think I've found a new favorite, although the wings are still good!\n\nI'm also impressed with their portion sizes! I can sure eat a lot, and I struggle to put away an entire large order! Now, they are quite expensive, but the large portion sizes are certainly a redeeming factor. Two people could probably share a large.\n\nOriginal review (focused on the wings): I love their wings. I get the double order of Suicide Wings, and the sauce is THE BEST! If you love buffalo wings, give this place a go! The wings are well cooked, juicy on the inside, and are steaming hot when brought out to you. The sauce is moderately spicy (I could go a little hotter), and tastes like heaven! Also, they always provide an abundance of sauce! Their fries are also cooked just right. I'm picky about how I like my fries, and Buffalo Joe's hits it out of the park each and every time. The fries are crispy on the outside and moist, but not soggy on the inside! Even better when dipped in their buffalo sauce, which they apply generously, so there's always enough left over to dip my fries in.\n\nPlease note that they are cash only, but they do have an ATM if you don't have any cash on you.

There are high top tables down the center and regular tables on the far wall that lead to the front. The d\u00e9cor consists of some signs, mirrors, bar memorabilia, and a handful of TVs. There is always fun and recognizable 80s music playing comfortably in the background. Even though KKatie's is a \"bar\", it is still a family-friendly place.  It is always bustling with conversation and children are certainly welcome. There is plentiful parking in the rear. There is a wheelchair-accessible entrance near the  back door. The bathrooms are  for individual use only, but they are always very clean and well-stocked.\n\nThe bartenders are savvy, fun, and adept at their craft. The wait staff is attentive and efficient. The cooks are just all All-Stars. They really know what they're doing. When you order one of their 8 oz burgers made with premium beef, medium comes out medium. A nice outer crust with a warm pink center as it should be.\n\nThis place is all about the hamburger. They are stacked high with the option of every conceivable topping. There are fried pickles,  peppercorns, bacon, different cheeses, fried eggs, caramelized onions, you name it. The perfectly buttered and grilled brioche buns seal the deal. There are also plenty of appetizers that are served up in generous portions. You can get quesadillas, boneless buffalo fingers, tater tots with different toppings, chicken wings, french fries, onion rings, the list goes on. The food prices are very fair, the portions are hearty.\n\nThe bar has a very nice selection of beers both on tap and in the bottle. There are lots of local beer, porters, ales, and stouts. Not to mention all the domestic and imported beers you'd recognize. The liquor selection is pretty vast and you can have any cocktail your palette could conjure.\n\nIt's a great place for small groups, couples or just to go by yourself to have an appetizer and a drink to watch an hour or two of the game.

They very well know insurance pays for all this and doesn\u2019t happen within the same day of which the accident occurred and he needed his pass.  Why should he come out of pocket just to get his handicap sticker?  This is exploitation at its finest.  Not informing someone of this policy beforehand and taking vehicle without authorization without offering to get stuff out of vehicle.  Then telling someone bill must be paid in full before you can even get anything out of or access vehicle.  Denying an elderly man his handicap pass by holding his vehicle hostage?

{"text":"I am a service connected disabled vet with a spinal injury that affects my left leg.ie: chronic pain, weakness, numbness, paralysis with frequent acute painful spasms. I have been treated by the Veterans Administration and a few civilian orgs. through the past two decades. The VA has done a good job in all of my medical treatment needs.  However, all systems have limits. All patients have different needs.All western medical treatment has been tried for me, short of major surgery, with limited but marginally acceptable results. The most effective pain management tool, and least desirable tool,  for many painful conditions is narcotic medication.This has been a wall many have lived against for years. Recently I requested an alternative to the narcotics. I was truly expecting the same response  as with other times before. The Narcotics in combination with other meds and therapies is most effective. However, this time I was offered, by the VA, acupuncture for pain relief. It is not done directly by the VA, but under new rules it is contracted out to local professional clinicians. As many Americans are, I lived in an area where western medicine, ie: pharmaceuticals, PT, and surgery, reigns supreme. I decided to approach this  new idea (new to me) with an open mind. The drugs were dulling my brain and I needed to try something else. The VA put me in contact with Eastern and Western Medical Center in Worcester Mass.  First I was scheduled for several acupuncture treatments to see  how it worked for me. At first, (the first three to four treatments) I was not completely sure what I was experiencing. It was not negative that was certain. As the next several treatments proceeded it became clear  that my chronic pain level was lower and the acute spasms had reduced in frequency and severity. I requested more treatments based on positive results. I received 12 more treatments over the next few months. I just had my 20th treatment and I cannot say I am all fixed and cured, but I will say, I am very happy with my new way I feel. I have significantly less pain. I am able to move more with less pain and I am starting to regain some movement and consequently more strength in parts of my leg and foot. I am very happy with my new situation. There is still more to discover. I don't know what the long term results will be and what the treatment requirement for maintaining positive results will be. But I do know It is a relatively painless treatment that, as it is administered by the very professional and proficient Acupuncturist EWMC of Worcester,  it is a relaxing, effective, and potentially life changing treatment. I believe, as is the case with all medical treatment, not all patients will have the same results. There are just to many differences from case to case. I can only say, I approached this treatment with an open mind and commitment  to cooperate with the Doctor's instructions and suggestions  to optimize the effects of the treatments.\nMy initial impression of This Medical center was very positive. It is an environment of professionalism without the cold clinical chill. Everyone is personable, and proficient but with a touch of warmth. The facility is very clean. The treatment of \"the whole patient\" is the priority and that includes an environment which supports a peaceful state of mind, along with privacy and safety.\nI am about four months into my treatment and relationship with Eastern Medicine. I have recommended this medical science and art to members of my family and to my close friends. I do not hesitate to give my best recommendation for Eastern and Western Medical Center, Worcester, MA to any one who wants or needs a change or supplement to their current  wellness treatment needs.\nSincerely,\nMark M.\n\"A Very Satisfied Customer\"","target_text":"I am a service connected disabled vet with a spinal injury that affects my left leg.ie: chronic pain, weakness, numbness, paralysis with frequent acute painful spasms.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I will start with the good.  I absolutely LOVE my apartment.  The homes are very nice inside.  First floor units (which I am in) have all vinyl flooring, except the bedroom is carpet, and they have 12 ft ceilings.  The maintenance staff is AMAZING and the few times I have had to request maintenance it was usually handled within a day or two.\n\nNow the not so good.  This is the first place I have ever lived where I do NOT feel safe.  So much so I now own a 12 gauge shotgun- more on this in a minute.  My first year here there were a lot of car's being broken into in the garage around Christmas.  Understandable as it was the holiday season however, this continued into March.  The very first crime meeting I attended, the Addison police came and basically said it was OUR fault for not having car alarms and leaving things in view in our car.  One guys truck was completely stolen.  We asked for cameras and were told they are a false sense of security - pretty much the same as the gate for the garage.  I did see TWO brand new trucks sitting on all four brake calipers as all four wheels on both, on different floors in the garage, were stolen INSIDE the gate.  Needless to say this was the first and last crime meeting I attended.\n\nBeing that I am on the first floor near a door to the garage, I hear everything.  I even hear people trying to come in to my apartment at 3 am.  Remember the 12 gauge?  This is the reason.  The first time this happened I thought maybe someone drunk tried the wrong door.  The second time was enough for me to protect myself.  I wrote the office a nice long letter after the crime meeting detailing my issues - I was told I could install a home alarm system.  I hear all the yelling, screaming, laughing and running that goes on in the hallways at all hours of the night\/morning (mostly night).  I had a neighbor above me that had a toddler and I could only assume he was practicing to be a professional bowler. You CAN hear your neighbors on ALL sides.  This is an apartment so some noise is expected.  I do not fault management for what the tenants do, but those saying they can't hear anything???  I have to question that.  Also, it seems like once a month here lately we have to evacuate for a smoke alarm.  Some units had to even evacuate when SWAT was called.  That was not my floor\/area, but we did receive an email about the incident.  I'm assuming something domestic and again, management can not be held accountable for that, right?\n\nThe doors to the buildings are accessible with a key fob.  Maybe it's my building, but the doors are constantly broke on the first floor.  I think because tenants yank and pull on them and break them.  Cameras would be a good investment on all key fob doors as you could then charge the tenants that break them.  It's really a pain to go grocery shopping, come home with all your bags in your hands and you can't get in the door.  When this happens I call the office and boy do they get irritated having to come let you in.  I was even told the door on the other side of the building worked and I should use it instead of calling the office.  My response - This one should work too.\n\nI haven't dealt much with the office, but the few times I have I was not treated in a nice manner.  One girl in particular rolls her eyes and acts as if she can't be bothered.  I assume it's me as she's always been like this to me.  She's the one that has come to let me in when the doors are broke so it probably is me...  In summary, this IS an apartment.  You can and will hear your neighbors.  I will be leaving when my lease is up in the next few months.  I'm tired of not feeling safe, wondering if my car will still be there and hearing all of the yelling in the hallway.  My safety is way more important to me than what my home looks like.  One final note, it is common knowledge that the management company offers incentives for good reviews.  Please keep that in mind as you do your research.","target_text":"The doors to the buildings are accessible with a key fob.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"The quality of food at Chow Hall 227 is disgraceful. We are trying to meet the nutritional needs of warriors, not meet the quota of a soup kitchen. I have noticed that over the weekends the quality and quantity of food is far worse than during weekdays. Likely because that is when management and Marine Corps higher does not eat at the chow halls. The only reason I believe the food is stomachable during the work week is because it is under the \"watchful\" eye of management and Marine Corps command. If I was able to attach images, I would share with you what they expect us to eat. Today's pathetic portions consisted of a stew containing mostly the entrails and scraps of chicken and two shriveled, burnt potato slices. That is what this chow hall considers a meal fit for high performance athletes. If the Marine Corps aim is to teach its warriors how to stomach disgusting and little amounts of food, its goal has been met. You will likely find more of these reports as I have encouraged more of my peers to talk about how they truly feel this chow hall serves them. It is disappointing to know that the portions and quality of food in our high schools of this great nation are already subpar. What I have seen in this chow hall sets that as the gold standard. I recently came back from deployment in Japan. The quality of food in the chow hall, on the much smaller base in Japan, far surpassed the standards here on Camp Lejeune. The resources on that base, I imagine, were much more limited than what we have accessible here in the United States of America. I would almost consider it up to par for an athlete. How is it that a smaller base in Japan is able to meet the standard, yet we struggle stateside on larger bases which are preparing our warriors to deploy overseas? Another discrepancy I found with this chow hall is the service from the staff. It is commonly known that the staff is rude to its guests, giving attitude where kindness should be found. I am uncertain if it is other Marines that come in and make a mess and disrespect the staff, but the Marines I attend chow with treat the staff with kindness and courtesy and are met with disrespect. I can understand that it is not the most desirable job to be a part of the chow hall staff, however this is no excuse for being rude to others. I can't say the chow hall isn't trying to improve the quality. iPads with surveys are available in the chow hall for us to complain to, but it's like preaching to the choir and no actions have been made to correct any of these issues. I will make it a point to complain about all meals I see unfit for a Marine. I am not asking for my voice to be heard I am asking for action to be taken.","target_text":"The resources on that base, I imagine, were much more limited than what we have accessible here in the United States of America.","annotation":"unrelated"}

It is organized very well. I gave it a four star rating because of the way its laid out. I understand how store plans work but this one needs some revision. I couldn't find pajamas anywhere. I'm disabled and the walking around a store to locate something that should be in plain sight caused me to quit looking and just take the clothes I did find. I also noticed that they have their clearance items spread out through each department instead of one area and the price not clearly marked. And a great deal of intimate items with replacement tags, giving me reason to believe these items are returns. All in all a very clean, neat and well lite store.","target_text":"I'm disabled and the walking around a store to locate something that should be in plain sight caused me to quit looking and just take the clothes I did find.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"Brunswick\/south  Location was inexcusable. I will never stay there again or recommend it.  We booked two rooms a month in advance, and  I still could not get a handicap access room like I needed. We were staying for two days. When we got there the AC had already been turned on. And it was terrible hot. After an hour the room still wasn't cooling down and we called and they said we'd just have to wait it would cool down. So...we waited till after dark..and our room was still so hot I was getting physically sick. Not to mention we had two kids with us. Finally we called back and told them it was still not working and someone came down. All he did was stand there and look at it and feel the vent. That was it.  He said he could not move us  because they were all booked up. But he could bring me a desk fan.  I personally don't know how they were booked up because they were lots of rooms that appeared to be empty to me. But anyways..I said a fan would help. So anyways.. four hours later I still had not gotten my fan!! So I called back and asked and the guy said he didn't know anything about it but he'd bring me a fan. When he brought it to me the fan didn't even work!!! We took the fan back and he said he'd have to call someone else and he'd let us know something...well I guess you know we never heard back from them. My husband had to go and PURCHASE a fan because I was getting sick from the heat. Oh they said they  could move us the next day.... but it would be that afternoon. So yeah.  In the meantime we had to just sweat it out. If they had've  tried to help us some..or even seemed concerned...or even offered to discount our rooms....something...then I wouldn't be leaving this review. I don't believe in leaving bad reviews when they companies try to help correct the situation. But this  particular location didn't seem to care.

{"text":"Resthaven deserves a negative rating.  They clearly take advantage of those who are grieving.\n\nIn 2011, I was a newly divorced, single-parent, on SSDI and in a wheelchair due to a severe stroke.  My 27-year old daughter unexpectedly passed away in Houston, TX.  I dealt with her arrangements alone.\n\nWith Resthaven:  Phone messages are not returned.  Crucial actions with my daughter were performed without my consent.  The prices I was charged were way too high.  My daughter\u2019s marker and vase are not cared for nor protected.  Appropriate empathy for me at a time of grief was not evident.\n\nEmbalmed without consent:  While my daughter's body was awaiting autopsy, someone from Resthaven asked if I'd like her body embalmed.  I couldn't make that decision at that time - I wasn't sure - and left it at that.  When this Resthaven person called to say the autopsy was finished, I said 'Let's get her home'.  When he called later to provide me an update, I told him I'd decided against embalming.  He said her body had already been embalmed because he thought 'Let's get her home' meant I wanted embalming.  No.  No, it didn\u2019t mean that.\n\nPrice point:  Several times I asked Resthaven to provide the cheapest way allowed by law.  They assured me they would.  Their price was horrendous \u2013 more than double the average funeral prices shown on TV.  By splitting the costs with my ex, I used all of my savings and had to borrow the remainder.  After 9-years, I\u2019m still in financial peril.\n\nVase not protected:  Several months after her funeral, my daughter\u2019s vase from her marker was stolen.  When questioned, Mike from Resthaven told me they have thefts there.  I looked around, and hers was the only one missing.  So, \u201cDo you want to buy another one?\u201d Mike asked.  No. No, I don\u2019t want to buy another one.\n\nMarker uncared for: In June 2020, my son visited his sister\u2019s gravesite.  Her marker looked terrible.  The Resthaven receptionist said they should certainly take care of that and offered to route my call to Mike.  I left a message on his voicemail.  No response.  I called again and left a voicemail with a woman regarding the same subject.  No response.  A third call from me to Resthaven resulted in a woman saying I shouldn\u2019t use anything on the marker because the warranty would be broken.  If I don\u2019t like the way it looks, I should buy another. Then, she offered to meet with the Resthaven team about the uncared-for marker and call me back.  Never called.\n\nI hate that my phone messages are not returned; crucial actions with my daughter were performed without my consent; the Resthaven prices I was charged were way too high; my daughter\u2019s marker and vase are not cared for nor protected and appropriate empathy for me at a time of grief was not evident.

{"text":"Ehh, I'm not a fan.  When they made a deal with Harris Teeter to trade locations and we lost a really great store.  I appreciate this store trying to step it up and improve, but I have voiced many concerns with management such as these, yet they still do things their way.\n\n1.  The meat - particularly the beef is more expensive than any other store in hickory.  You can get prime beef at dockside ( the fish market of all places) for almost the same price as choice from here.  They do offer dry age beef but the prices are so high, it's ridiculous...  I've ordered dry aged steaks at many restaurants where it's not as expensive - and I don't have to make it myself at home.\n2.  The seafood is almost all previously frozen - even when it is advertise as fresh - it's usually previously frozen.  I buy a lot of fresh seafood (not from here) and when something is advertised as fresh, it should be fresh.  I've unfortunately bought stuff from here that I've specifically asked if it was previously frozen (because it was advertised as fresh and almost looked convincing enough) and they kept insisting that it was not - only to find out that it was in fact previously frozen.  The people in the seafood dept have a hard time answering questions regarding the product they sell.  They don't know when it came in and they don't know where it's from.\n3.  My comments and suggesting fall on deaf ears.  I've suggested they keep certain items\/products in stock and they simply refuse.\n4. Other examples would be the mishandling of products they already do sell for example - their tiny overpriced artichokes.  I've mentioned to the produce managers to stop chopping the entire stem off of them otherwise no one would buy them...  every time I'd go in, they would be completely cut off all the way to the heart.  It's super aggravating for someone that likes to cook them or cook with them.  Wal-Mart, food lion, and now Publix does not find it necessary to cut off and discard so much of the product you are already paying a premium for.\nMy expectations or standards are not any higher than any other grocery stores I've shopped at.\nHarris Teeter would have bone in rib eyes for $7.99 on sale - Lowe's NEVER does that not even without the bone (your new neighbor Publix does)  they have a wide selection of fresh, never frozen seafood at very reasonable prices and so did Harris teeter - if they were able to do it, I know that surely you could too - if you wanted to.\n\nOverall there are a handful of other non produce related items that they price gouge on such as their led light bulbs(around $20 for a single led bulb) - you can buy them for literally a fraction of the cost at home depot or Lowe's hardware(roughly $4-$5 even when they are not on sale).\nFor a long time you didn't have to care because you were the only game in town and from my perspective I sure do believe you acted as such.  Well now, things have changed and we have more options - great options at that.","target_text":"My comments and suggesting fall on deaf ears.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"So to keep this short (long) my wife and I are very quiet and clean people. When we moved out (due to many aspects about the place) we had the carpets and walls cleaned. This place was spotless and cleaner than when we moved in..... I even fixed water damage in the garage that was there when we moved in because EPM took over a year and did nothing after showing me the place \"Oh, wow that is bad I will have a work order put in.\" Enjoy the fees listed in the attached image (google is verifying the image before posting). $90 for blinds replacements that were never touched. Also googled these old metal blinds and they are $15 a pop and there are two in the entire place. $140 for damaged paint (when we moved in one bedroom had a red spot likely from bed sheets and we cleaned this and other pre-existing marks off the walls.....) so spotless walls. $70.40 for general damage...... I wonder what that was for seeing as we fixed damage that was there on move in (reference garage). $54 for general cleaning after we cleaned every square inch spotless. They moved someone in the day after (I have a written email from management confirming this) we were out so clearly their charged cleaning, painting, and damage fixing NEVER HAPPENED. They still charged for it though.. Don't trust just me who will lose over $360 in miscellaneous fees for things that never actually happened and won't change for the next tenants.. trust all the other reviews saying they scam people on the way out.

{"text":"Make sure you ask them well ahead if they actually have a qualified MD instead of a fresh out of the school NP with no experience before you pay the mandatory $125. Don\u2019t settle for anyone less please.\nAnd if you see a NP named Timothy Lomady run as fast as you can and save your money for another Urgent Care. He\u2019s grossly unqualified.\n\nIf you wanna know why I\u2019m taking time to specifically name this facility keep reading. This could actually save you money.\n\nSo I went in there a few days ago for a possible UTI and a couple other symptoms that were bothering me. They gave me a NP instead of an MD. The analysis came back negative. He couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s causing my symptoms and just sent me back with a Rx for antibiotic.\nI was having some pain below my left rib and he didn\u2019t seem to have any theories for that either. And the pain got worse the next day.\nAnother thing is the swollen eyelid with a tiny lump inside and he thought it was just dry eyes and suggested I use the eye drops and it hasn\u2019t gotten any better either.\nHe seemed pretty nice in his misdemeanor and all but niceness doesn\u2019t cure diseases.\n\nSo I\u2019m out $200 ($125 upfront+ $75 for X-ray) big dollars and it only got worse in the following days. Apparently the $200 is only good for a NP at this place. Maybe I could get an MD if I opted in for the next tier of care for say $500?\n\nThis place is a joke and if you\u2019re planning on paying out-of-pocket then you will be robbed blind. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU FEEL LIKE BURNING MONEY. I could\u2019ve made more money investing in $GME (GameStop).Less healthier and  more poorer.\n\nUPDATE: I went back again since the pain got consistently worse when the highly qualified NP, pun intended, said it was nothing. I was asked to pay the $125 again and the reason? It\u2019s a \u201cdifferent provider\u201d and that they\u2019re obligated to rob me twice as if paying for the abysmal care once wasn\u2019t enough.\nIt\u2019s cuz of corporations like these that the healthcare system is such a joke.

{"text":"THE WORST PLACE TO LIVE. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! They claim it is dog friendly yet all the miserable people who have lived there for most likely their whole lives are not fond of new comers with dogs and literally make it impossible for anyone to live comfortably. I felt harassed and discriminated against every single day I lived there. I couldn't walk my dog without a neighbor making a remark or having something to say, in a negative connotation. Again my puppy was not even 1 year old when I moved there and these people made it their mission to sabotage her growth and instill fear into her. Neighbors harassed me regarding my dog which was and is still actually a puppy(EMS); which not only made my puppy uncomfortable but also made it difficult to train her because those are the most important stages for them to socialize.\n\nI could NOT WAIT for my lease to be up so I can RUN! I do not suggest this place for anyone. They are very inconsiderate of your needs or concerns regarding maintenance and they do not respect the Fair Housing Act. They discriminate against people with disabilities and do not have any respect whatsoever. They are being looked into by the Fair Housing Council.\nThe people working at Brookchester need to be better educated and learn to respond professionally rather than with their miserable attitudes.  The first day I moved in the door frame broke and it was never fixed nor replaced. They did not provide me with an air conditioner for my room until I learned from a neighbor that they were supposed to- even on those summer days where it was considerably hot. The heating is DISGUSTING- you have NO CONTROL over it and it literally STEAMS your entire apartment into a SAUNA; I had to use my Air Conditioner throughout winter! The bathroom sink clogged everyday, even after maintenance supposedly \"fixed it.\" The shower head was broken and sprayed everywhere- i mentioned this to maintenance and they never fixed it. One of the worst and most uncommon issues I've ever had to deal with was the FACT that these apartments do no offer mailboxes. They literally throw your mail on the floor. it's deplorable. (So imagine coming home on a rainy day and your mail is on the floor soaked and wet, not even considering the fact that dogs will get bored and chew anything up in sight....)\n\nHonestly the most horrible experience to have dealt with, I am just glad it's over- or at least until I receive my security deposit back- which is another displeasure. I've been in contact several weeks after moving out and they have not even processed my security deposit return check. Whenever I call there is a lady Carolyn who always gives a detestable attitude, completely aggravated woman.

I have noticed that since the sale of the dealership the service department has gone down in customer service tremendously.

{"text":"DO NOT STAY HERE!  The absolute worst resort I have EVER been to.  Our annual family trip to the river we decided to stay at the Avi instead of our normal downtown Laughlin hotel thinking it would be more kid friendly.  We had a total of 3 rooms 7 adults and 5 kids.  Spent a ton of money between rooms, food and gambling.  Our first day down by their so-called \"beach\" and this is what happened.  The sand on the beach was so hot that within 2 steps my husbands foot had 2nd degree burns and eventually ended up 3 weeks later with an amputation.  The worst thing of all was after returning from the local hospital, I was visably upset and I brought the hot sand to the managers attention and the fact that there were NO WARNING SIGNS and was treated with such disrespect and disregard I was amazed in disgust.  I asked if I could please have a wheelchair for the remainder of the weekend and was told that it is not their policy and there is nothing they were going to do to help my husband get around for the weekend and to please step away from the desk.  I ended up going to the Aquarius Hotel in downtown Laughlin who were more than happy to lend me a wheelchair for the weekend.  After doing my research and realizing that because they are on \"tribal ground\" they basically don't answer to US laws and are free to do as they wish and have no guidelines but their own to follow.  So no matter what happens on their property they are not responsible if they don't want to be. Then it all made sense... I do not wish this nightmare on anyone.  My husband is now possibly losing his second toe due to these burns and it has been 2 months since the incident.

{"text":"My name is Donarius Crochett, and I shop at Lowe\u2019s quite frequently for my home and business needs. However, I recently received a horrible experience with (Lowes Home Services) which I believe no one or any other family members that contribute towards Lowes company should have to experience. On March 19th, after going back and forth with all your competitors, I decided to move forward with you all on the Window Services and Installation. I was first introduced to your representative Roy Powers back in January, where he came out to my residence and presented a presentation I wouldn\u2019t forget. During the presentation, Roy continually went on and on about how he was well experienced in this line of work, and doing service orders like this was an easy job for the Lowes Team. This made me feel quite confident to decide to go with Lowes Home Services (20201 I-45, 77388) at your Spring, Texas location than your other competitors. Roy Powers stated, \u201che\u2019ll work on the contract and agreement and once done, send it to my email to sign off on.\u201d Then, I would just need to go to the Spring, Tx location and pay. Once the contract and agreement were completed, it was sent over. I signed off on it and headed to the (20201 I-45, 77388) Spring, Texas location where Roy Power consistently called my phone saying, \u201cI\u2019m in the Planet Ford dealership parking lot if you need me.\u201d This seems odd to me because I expected he would be professional enough to meet me at the location he said was okay to pay for the order. Once I paid for my order, I called Roy Powers and told him the order was paid for and thanked him for the assistance. Being that it is now May, Roy Powers and the agreement mentioned it would take up to ten weeks for the windows and installation to be completed. My orders\u2019 original expected delivery date would have been around June. However, I received a call this week on May 3rd from Roy advising me that he forgot to place my order for my windows, and it was nothing that could be done about it but reorder them, something he clearly didn\u2019t do the first time. I asked Roy to reach out to a supervisor and call me back to better understand the situation, especially after waiting over five weeks with no communication. Twenty-four hours later, Roy called me back with no supervisor, and when I asked what the supervisor said, he said the supervisors' mom died, and nothing could be done to rectify the situation besides reorder the windows that were never ordered. I asked Roy Powers to call me back with a supervisor, and he said you do have the option of canceling the order and getting your money back. I still haven\u2019t heard anything from Roy Powers since our last conversation in which he promised me he would call me back with a supervisor. I have already paid and expected my order soon, only to be told I would have to wait additional time and could do nothing else to compensate for the employees\u2019 mistake. As a business owner myself, if there is an error on my end, I will make sure to go above and beyond to correct any mistakes and find a solution. I hope that a corporation like yourself would do the same, and we can agree to get my issue resolved. As a person with a disability, I felt that Roy Powers and Lowes, as a company, have taken advantage of the disabled. I find this unacceptable, especially for a company like Lowes. I always believed you all to be a company of Integrity.

There are so many things I didn't understand fully in the process and he took the time to explain them.\n\nMy SSDI qualification was ongoing for the past 2.5 years and I honestly had no idea where that stood.

{"text":"Excellent experience!  I recently had surgery and was afraid I would need a wheelchair to access park.  The woman who sold my ticket reassured me that there was a tram that could carry us to various destinations within the gardens, as well as took the time to tell us about which areas would be best at this time of year.  The gardens were fragrant, orderly and beautiful.  The tram had a tour-bus recording that played and gave information about the different areas of the park.  The conservatory was outstanding, esp. the simulated rainforest and the conifers were awesome.  I LOVED IT HERE.  So much more than Brooklyn Botanical Garden.","target_text":"I recently had surgery and was afraid I would need a wheelchair to access park.","annotation":"unrelated"}

After finding BR is open, we braved the cold in hopes they would have cakes left.\nI specifically searched Instacart and filtered the google search for businesses that are open today. And BR still came up as open and acted like it would let me do a doordash order; which usually implies the store is open.\nI would presume that places wouldn\u2019t be open on Christmas day. But since it was allowing me to order, I cant assume that everybody is closed today. Not everyone celebrates Christmas or especially now wants to be home.\nTo make it worse there were cars in the parking lot, and several other customers who came through the drive thru thinking it was open. You just need to tell customers if you\u2019re open or not and be clear about that. It\u2019s not that complicated to do.","target_text":"We have a disabled vet in the family who was so desperate to get dessert to celebrate.","annotation":"unrelated"}

That's not the end of this review.\n\nI brought a pair of favored dress shoes to Shoe & Leather Repair simply ready to ask if they could be salvaged. I've never done this before, so I thought I'd just ask.\n\nFirst of all, this place has been around for a LONG time and has a great reputation in Washington.

Bob, the owner, did amazing work.\n\nSo with those two things in mind - its reputation and the work I'd seen on the boots - I went in blind. Bob immediately put his work down and came over to assist me, even turning down the television that was on in the background. He looked at my shoes and pulled at them, debating if they could be saved. He seemed eager to give it a shot, but after prodding around a bit, he gave me the honest answer that he did not think they could be saved. There was too much damage.\n\nThe way in which he assessed my shoes gave me total confidence in his diagnosis. And I really appreciate that! I asked him what other kind of work he did in the shop, because it clearly had types of tools for all manner of items. He rattled off a list of things he repairs - which ranged from shoes and purses to other non-leather items - and summed it all up by saying, \"Basically, if it's something that can be sewn, I can do it!\"\n\nWith that I said goodbye, he turned the tv back on, and got straight back to what he was working on before I came in.\n\nThough I can't personally recommend any work he's done for me, I will absolutely be back if I ever have another shoe or leather issue to see what he thinks!","target_text":"So with those two things in mind - its reputation and the work I'd seen on the boots - I went in blind.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"4-12-2021 update -- Received letter in mail asking me to choose a different hotel in the future and banned me from the property. letter doesn't give a reason but I believe its because I filed a complaint with choice hotels and a bad google review. I looked at other reviews and it looks like I'm not the only one.\n\nI stayed 2 nights in room 412. I paid extra to get a night room upgrade. Soon as I arrive and checked in, I went up to my room and room service was in there cleaning so I had to wait. There was a big puddle in the middle of the floor that she needed to mop up. After she was done she let me in. Well first lamp I went to the bulb was out. So I went over to the blind to raise it to let light in. As I tried to raise the blind it was messed up. Well I\u2019m not normally one who complains so I work with the blind and finally get it working at least temporarily. As I got settled in and got my devices connected to the internet, witch by the way requires you to sign in about every hour, then I tried to use the tv. Well the tv remote would barley work. So deal with it the first night because at the time I\u2019m waiting on food I was having delivered. Well the hotel advertised it had a tv cast option that I was excited to use. I tried to figure it out but come to find out it was disconnected on the back of the tv. I reconnected it and it worked. Not sure why it wasn\u2019t hooked up. After a long day of bad luck I go to get my shower. I look up and the shower head was nasty. I took a picture and will try to attach it to the post. I decide to take a bath instead of using the shower head. It took about 30 minutes for the very small tub to fill up because the hotel didn\u2019t have good water pressure. So after I get done with the bath I get into bed. The bed sound like it could fall apart any minute and is hard as laying on the floor\u2026 second day I go down about 430 pm and ask guest services to replace the tv remote batteries. The guy was on the company phone with a personal phone call. This would explain why when I called the hotel it took forever to get someone. The guy looked at the tv remote and asked me why it needed batteries so I explained. Then he asked me how long I was staying with them. So I told him it was my last night. He said the remote needed a screw driver and he didn\u2019t have one. Well I always carry a kit with me because I work on computers. So I told him he could use mine. He said it required a special screw driver witch I had but he didn\u2019t care. He said he would come up to my room in a couple hours to fix it. So I waited but I knew he would never come. About 830pm 4hours I got tired of waiting so I got a bath and went to bed. No one ever showed, shocker. The next morning I go to check out and asked the lady at the front desk about the free hot breakfast. She advised me they had burritos in a fridge that I could warm up. I don\u2019t consider that a hot breakfast or even any breakfast. The hotel claims to be recently remodeled and I asked the hotel room service how long ago it was remodeled. She informed me it was over 2years ago. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Choice hotels are great but unfortunately this one is the worst one I have ever seen. I do not hold choice hotels responsible for this because I know they have many different hotels and most of them are really nice. I think this one just feel through the cracks. My advice is to find a alternative hotel.","target_text":"So I went over to the blind to raise it to let light in. As I tried to raise the blind it was messed up.

{"text":"It's 830am on a Holiday (no school) and my handicapped child was up till 230am not feeling well. Thought we could sleep in since it was a holiday but construction workers woke us up early banging so loud it sounds like they're in our apt and drilling to the point my daughters whole bedroom is vibrating . I begged them to stop, they wldnt. I begged several people who work at the complex to help, they cldnt. This is one of a million reasons it's a terrible place to live. Only 2 ppl that work in the main office are nice, the rest are nasty, dont help u, giv u disconnected numbers or promise you'll get a call back about ur issue and then u nvr hear from anyone and they dont fix the problems. It takes months to get a maintenance request fulfilled after u r treated poorly over and over for requesting it and usually hung up on before you're done speaking with them. Management does not care how you're treated by staff and does not monitor their phone calls. The rates go up by approx $100\/month each time your yearly renewal is up. There are dangerous walkways that haven't been fixed for years, there is no tennis court bc they use it to store supplies and as a road that anyone can drive through. The gym they hav only includes a handful of machines,  most of which are broken to the point you cld sue them if you were injured on one. The clubhouse is rarely open which is the only place to get your laundry card refilled. The construction workers and maintenance crews drive up the curbs and onto the grass and walkways so there is no place safe for your children to play. For months and months there were issues with the water and it was often that it was either turned off or more likely there was no heat running through it and it was too cold to shower. Several times the water was turned off in summer at the same time they closed the pool for repairs. Once a worker crashed into my car in the parking lot and when I reported it they did nothing. They had a Caterpillar investation 2 summers ago that they took so to approve the cleanup of that it got to the point they were covering your car, the parking lot, the walls if the building, your front door, the sidewalks.. residents were taking to the streets to kill them on their own and all the property manager cld say was he had no idea when they wld b doing something about it. They were putting up new siding on the buildings at this time and the workers sealed the Caterpillars into the building under the new siding. The ONLY good thing I can say, is I've never lived in an apartment where bees couldn't get through somehow, and I've lived here for years and not a single one has come in. Don't live here.

So they made us wait for the next rotation. We had reservations and they had empty tables... not sure what that was all about. We ordered the traditional turkey diner and were surprised to see the skimpiest portion of turkey thrown on top of the potatoes. Literally only two bites of turkey which was cold. Everything is now priced separately and way OVER priced for the quality of food. This was our third time back to the Shack since coming under new management and will be our last. We have been coming to the Shack since the early eighties but this new management does not have the same quality. Each time we tried we were disappointed.

Everything is included with your general ticket including a tour bus ride to the launch sites. However, you can upgrade to other packs that include lunch with an astronaut for a nominal up charge.

And if traveling in a wheelchair or have special needs they are very accommodating! Lots of places to sit in the shade with benches or tables to take in the views of the rocket garden and other outdoor exhibits. All dossiers have hands on experienced with guidance or other operations of crafts so ask a lot of questions they love it! This time of year is Christmas so they have the park light up at night!

{"text":"This has to be the worst Walmart I have ever been to. I have shopped at Walmart all over the country and the stores are always clean, well organized, staff polite & helpful even when they are super busy. This place? Has the worst customer service. Worse than the major east coast based grocer down the road. This store is massive yet is cramped and messy. It looks like management tried to cram as many shelves and merchandise in as possible. Aisles are too narrow to turn a cart around much less a handicap scooter. The store has insufficient handicap parking and scooters. Grocery staples are decently stocked but fresh vegetables & deli is a joke. Old produce, out of stock, rude employees, dirty, unappealing. The pharmacy staff is horrible. This unit is 6 miles from my home yet I drive to another location to shop, 15 miles away, that I have to use a toll road to get to. Due to a worsening disability, I get my groceries delivered now. The only option i have is Walmart. Yes, this Walmart, that i refuse to set foot in. The delivery people are wonderful. The process Walmart uses in this unit to service pick up and delivery customers is abysmal. They have a seperate store set up in the back that services us. If that store is out of an item, they aren't allowed to go into the regular store to get it. A substitution is made by their software to replace the ordered item. 75%  of the time, that substitution has no resemblance to what was ordered. I have complained so many times to the unit management and calling customer service that I have given up. Every delivery comes with a call to customer service to be compensated for an item I cannot use. Last week they forgot to send an entire bag of items totaling over 30 dollars that a supervisor had to approve a refund for. I had to ask a neighbor to go to another grocery store to get those groceries for me. I wouldn't shop at this unit but I have no choice. Walmart will not deliver to my address from another unit. I can only hope that someone from Walmart sees this and will do something about it. The store is at 33rd & Tower Rd in Denver, Co.

{"text":"*UPDATED REVIEW*\nI was not impressed with the way we were given this apartment.  It was dirty, and many other issues.  You can read my original review below.\n\nHowever, management took it upon themselves to call me regarding this review, without me saying a word about it.  They apologized for the things that they could no longer fix, and told me they would make right the cleanliness issues.  I went out of town last week and came back to every single issue I brought up being resolved.  The blinds are now brand new, the dirt in the vents was cleaned, the damage under the sink from the water leak was completely fixed, and best of all the counter tops were completely resurfaced.  They look great!\n\nI stand by my statement that for the price the unit should be updated, however the way management handled the situation was excellent, and I appreciate that very much.  Updating from 1 to 4 stars.  If I had plans to rent after my 6 month lease, I would now definitely stay here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nGarbage.  I've been here exactly 5 days.  The furnace had to be completely replaced.  The water pipe under the sink was leaking very bad and had to be replaced.  Still have not had my washer and dryer delivered after being told repeatedly it would be delivered.  Have not been able to wash my clothes in almost a week. The counters are beat to hell, and the blinds and fans are extremely dirty.  This is after FIVE days.\n\nThe location is fantastic.  The grounds are gorgeous.  The apartments themselves are very outdated and overpriced for what you get.  These should be at least 200\/mo less than what they are.  I suppose the location jacks the price up.\n\nI don't think have I have ever written a bad review on a place, after such a short amount of time.  But this is a bit silly.  I am very glad I signed only a 6 months lease, as we will not be staying here any longer than that.\n\nA final word of advice, go over all the costs ahead of time.  There are a ton of fees hidden once you receive the lease.  Also makes sure you walk through YOUR unit you will be in if you can.  They showed me a remodeled unit and this one hasn't been updated in many, many years.","target_text":"The blinds are now brand new, the dirt in the vents was cleaned, the damage under the sink from the water leak was completely fixed, and best of all the counter tops were completely resurfaced.

{"text":"I've stayed at Radisson Hotels all over the world, and this is by far the worst by a wide margin.  I am in no way am exaggerating this to any extent.  I stayed in Business Class Room 441 from 3-16-19 to 3-22-19.\n\nReception was terrible, as there was a long wait and the 2 night employees looked like they crawled out of a dumpster.  Their clothes were filthy and very mangled, wrinkled and unkempt.  Apparently shaving didn't make the list of requirements on the liberal dress code.\n\nRoom access is a complete joke, as you have to wind your luggage through the entire length of the hotel just to get to the 2 freight elevators that haven't been cleaned since the place opened.\n\nThe \"Business Class\" room was fair at best.  It was not in a separate section or floor and very noisy from other guests and their parties.  The rooms have not been cleaned very well, dust everywhere, painters top coat bubbles on the door and walls, towel rack hanging off the wall over the toilet, a semi-melted surge protector half attached to the desk, filthy windows, both inside and out, and the room handnt been vacuumed the entire week I stayed.\n\nHousekeeping was not very attentive at all and refused to vacuum the room even after several passive attempts to request it.  The bathroom amenities were barely replenished and coffee was refilled with mostly decaf if at all.  The sheets are supposed to be changed every other day, I think they may have done it once.\n\nThe restaurant was a complete joke.  I ordered the steak with steak fries and cheesy broccoli.  What I received was a dish that had barely made a pass through the warmer or microwave, box velveeta cheese over poured on top of everything and a steak that had quit breathing somewhere in the late 90's and was tough as shoe leather.\n\nThe lobby and lounge bar area was polluted by what some might consider a dive night club and its deafeningly loud music and drunk baby boomer crowd.\n\nThe bar service was fairly decent and served up some pretty good mixes, especially their house blood orange Old Fashioned.  The bartender Katy was an absolute pleasure to talk to while enjoying a drink at there and added her own flair to everything.  She was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about everything and very helpful in recommending a great drink.  I would venture to say my experience at her bar was the highlight of an otherwise gloomy stay in an outdated hotel.\n\nThe pool area seemed clean enough, although the hotel doesn't seem to mind the sopping wet kids running amuck all throughout the building.\n\nThe hotel does have overnight security, who seemed decently attentive to their jobs and posts, to include asking me to move my brand new vehicle to an area covered more thoroughly by camera coverage.  I definitely appreciated that.\n\nWhen these concerns were voiced to the staff at checkout, I was told that the Hotel Manager would be calling me, so far I have yet to hear from anyone.\n\nOverall, for what I paid for the Business Class room, I feel like I received Motel 6 quality.  I've paid less and had a much better experience in other Radisson hotels in Duabi and across Europe.  I don't think I will ever return to this particular location after this past week.","target_text":"The lobby and lounge bar area was polluted by what some might consider a dive night club and its deafeningly loud music and drunk baby boomer crowd..","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"I've been a member of Anytime Fitness for over 2 years (this gym is not my home gym).  I travel for a living and have been to dozens of Anytime Fitness locations over the years, and I know that they are a great company.  This gym needs a management check.  Once the management changes and Jackie no longer works there, it will be a decent facility, but until then don't wast your time.  I have a small special needs service dog that travels with me everywhere and I can't leave my dog in the car in the Arizona heat, so I placed her in her small travel bag and I had her next to my while I was using the stationary bike, and Jackie asked me to leave.","target_text":"I have a small special needs service dog that travels with me everywhere and I can't leave my dog in the car in the Arizona heat, so I placed her in her small travel bag and I had her next to my while I was using the stationary bike, and Jackie asked me to leave.","annotation":"negative"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this store if you have small children. I had an infant in an infant carrier and it was close to nap time so my toddler didn't want to walk. I found a cart in the parking lot so I put both of my children in. As soon as we walked in the door, an employee (possibly the manager) accosted me and told that they do not allow shopping carts from outside to come in their store. Did I mind putting my children in one of their carts. Actually, I did mind. My back hurts from lugging those precious parcels around all day. I wanted to walk out at that moment, but since I had already been to several stores and hadn't found a dress I need for a specific occasion I held my tongue and put my infant seat in their shopping cart. Their carts are so tiny that my toddler couldn't fit in the seat. So I got another shopping cart and put my toddler in it. The design on these carts is such that they pinch arms easily and my toddler received a 3 inch bruise from this cart.\nIt gets better. As I am awkwardly pushing my way through the store and down the LONG corridor to the ladies dressing room. On the way out of this long corridor we were 3\/4 of the way down this very narrow hallway. Their was a lady coming in to try on clothes. She was walking on crutches. I apologized profusely as she saw it was easier for her to back up a few steps than for me to push these 2 awkward carts back to where we came from. After we passed I saw that she had an amputated leg. How awkward. This area of the store is poorly designed.\nA couple of notes.\nA) This entire store needs a course in friendly customer service. The manager could have apologized, could have welcomed us to the store, but politely informed us of their policy instead of raising her voice at us the second we crossed the threshold.\nB) The waiting room attendant told me that I wouldn't be allowed to take any of my possessions in the dressing room. Really? You want my diaper bag and my kids? I ignored her.\nC) I don't know how you can consider this dressing room handicap accessible.\nD) Congratulate your staff on following the rules superbly. We won't be back any time soon.","target_text":"C) I don't know how you can consider this dressing room handicap accessible..","annotation":"negative"}

{"text":"Rented an apartment in a Lund Co property for over 3 years.  Property used to be great, but now is nowhere I would even think about living.  Despite what you are told at lease signing, tenants leave trash on patios, bags of garbage in halls, open and empty liquor bottles in boxes in halls, pet waste EVERYWHERE, and cars parked behind tenants garages so they are not accessible.  When the most recent set of office employees was contacted, nothing was done.  I was told one day well someone is here looking at a place I can\u2019t handle a complaint and give them a bad impression, you have your place just be patient.  Called customer care and was brushed off there as well.  Clearly do not care about tenants.  Will not rent from a Lund Property again.","target_text":"Despite what you are told at lease signing, tenants leave trash on patios, bags of garbage in halls, open and empty liquor bottles in boxes in halls, pet waste EVERYWHERE, and cars parked behind tenants garages so they are not accessible.","annotation":"unrelated"}

{"text":"We booked two connected rooms here based on photos we saw on the resort website - don't make the same mistake we did.\n\nWe were given rooms 701 & 601, southwest most rooms on the top floor.  The rooms were run down, dirty, and in need of serious TLC. Among the few things that we noted were a large stain in the foyer, missing vertical blinds and valance, non-functioning sliding bathroom door, two broken lamp fixtures, falling ceiling tiles, sand in the windowsills, dirty windows, thin yellowing bed linens (whatever the opposite of clean crisp fresh linens are), and a 1\/2 blocked \"panoramic\" ocean view (don't settle for this unit if you are paying for a full ocean view!).\n\nThese units, from our experience, are nothing like what were shown in the photos. This is a great study for how good lighting, camera angles and photo touch-ups can make any place look much better than it actually is. Also note that the lobby and the restaurant decor\/design are fantastic but that the units themselves are nothing like that. Units feel \"old\" and dirty.\n\nWe expressed our disappointment to management and they seemed uninvolved and uninterested in our predicament. They did send maintenance to take care of some of the issues but overall our interaction with management felt awkward; as if they were thinking \"yeah....and?\"\n\nWe drove from Southern California and we would never return.","target_text":"Among the few things that we noted were a large stain in the foyer, missing vertical blinds and valance, non-functioning sliding bathroom door, two broken lamp fixtures, falling ceiling tiles, sand in the windowsills, dirty windows, thin yellowing bed linens (whatever the opposite of clean crisp fresh linens are), and a 1\/2 blocked \"panoramic\" ocean view (don't settle for this unit if you are paying for a full ocean view!)..","annotation":"unrelated"}

Never leave subway with out a story.  Plus there's a really hot chick that works there..we call her \"subway girl\" .I wonder why shes there all the time when she could be at home having some handsome Abercrombie and Fitch lookin boy running but feet.   rumors say she's doing some undercover reality tv show ..maybe like punked? Or maybe like Chelsea lately ... Or maybe intervention. Anyways that subway is no ordinary subway...some say she's had her heartbroken so bad she just kinda lives in the back bathroom... Cause she just is tired of people and life.. Whatever it is she's very intriguing.
